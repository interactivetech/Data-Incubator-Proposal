Service", "content_en": "For the life of my Uber account I have never been able to request a ride. It seems there was an issue with my phone number being associated with 2 different emails. When I my first email didn\u2019t work I tried signing up with a new account. So I deleted the account associated with me outlook email and waited 30 days. I again tried to request a ride and my account was disable for security reasons. I have 10+ email responses and messages from the help tab in the Uber app saying the same thing (sometimes exactly the same to the character) that my account was disabled for security reasons but should be fixed. I\u2019ve been stranded at locations after closing hours without a ride because I was told my account was fixed but it wasn\u2019t. Customer service has been as helpful as they can be with their copy and paste responses. They told me to try to change my payment method. Account disabled. I\u2019ve tried logging out of the app and logging back in. Locked out of my account. And cannot even log back into the app to get the the help message i submitted so I have to submit a new request to get in contact with customer service. If I could call and talk to a real person to get some information on why this is happening maybe I could be a paying customer. I\u2019ve tried sending nasty informational messages with my problem and I\u2019ve tried sending monotoned informational messages. Nothing has allowed be to participate in this technology. I tried giving up on Uber and switching to Lyft but there are not many or no drivers in my town when I needed a ride.
