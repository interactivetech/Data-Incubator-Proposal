Driver did not disappoint and got us to our destination as quickly as possible even with a delay on the Schuylkill Expressway that was caused by a car fire in the east bound lane causing a gaper delay in our west bound lane.  Driver took everything in her stride and got us to our destination safely, quickly and very satisfied.  I gave her a big tip b/c reading the Uber info, I couldn\u2019t determine if the tip was included and I was very pleased with the service.
