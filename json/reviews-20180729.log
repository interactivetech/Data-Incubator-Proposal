Some improvements I would like to have made would be an eraser for the coloring pen and more filters. When I\u2019m using the markers and feel like erasing something, yet not taking away a part that I like. It can be a bit of a dilemma. Also, I don\u2019t like the filters I am getting, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a way for me to cater the filters to what I like, some serious, and some goofy. Also, I have zero clue what happened to my voice filters. Every time I try to press the sound button to get the options for voice distortion, it just has the mute. Is there anyway I can get them back?
