It crashed literally 20 times and I restarted my phone twice and it did nothing. Whenever I try to do anything where you have to pull up memories, whether it's to look for something to post from your camera roll or watch the flashback from that day, which has never worked for me before by the way, it crashed every single time. Like I can't press anything or it'll crash. This is so aggravating thought because I never had this problem before the update and now I like can't even use it anymore. I honestly just go on to send my streaks now because it's useless every other way. If you could fix the crashing in your next update instead of moving stories somewhere new so I have to keep getting use to it and adding more stickers that are so unnecessary and keep adding stuff that I never subscribe to on the discover page, that would be great. That's also another thing I want to say. Snapchat use to be all about a way of communication for you and your friends. Now it's a market place with adds every 10 seconds that now you can't even skip through and all this stuff jumbling and making my discover page look so crowded and messy. I honestly never read anything there and can't find half my friends stories which is supposed to be the purpose of this app. A form of communication between you and your friends, not some virtual news and market place. I've never written a review before but I honestly just had to write this one because this use to be my most used app and then all the changes started happening and that's when everything went down hill.", "id": "2971880770", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "1", "version": "10.36.0.23", "author": "Smokeywoof", "country": "US", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Snapchat"}
