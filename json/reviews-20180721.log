{"t": "21/Jul/2018:11:43:40 -07:00", "title": "What happened?", "content": "I appreciated Uber much, much more in its earlier stages. Rates used to be very moderate and consistent, and wait times for pools were hardly ever over five minutes.\n\nUnfortunately I don\u2019t own a car, and often times the public transportation system in my city is inconsistent, so sometimes I depend on Uber to get me where I need to go. It used to be one of my first choices, but now it\u2019s become quite the last resort.\n\nWhenever I request a pool (being that they\u2019re generally cheaper than an X or other versions) I have to wait anywhere from 10-20 minutes for my driver to arrive because for whatever reason the drivers that receive my request are always coming from the complete other side of the city. And even then, it takes minutes before I\u2019m actually connected to a driver. What happened? I used to wait probably two to seven minutes to be picked up, so that\u2019s quite a significant difference. \n\nCalling an X can be a nightmare because of the outrageous rates nowadays as well.
