I use it totals to my friends and communicate with basically everyone. Snapchat can be bad depending on the people you are dealing with. Some people send highly inappropriate things to one another which should be completely blocked from the app. At my age the people I know we all basically use this to talk. No one texts anymore it\u2019s Snapchat I don\u2019t have half the people\u2019s number that I have on Snapchat because we don\u2019t need to text anymore it\u2019s just Snapchat is the way you get people talk and while adults think that it\u2019s such a bad app it isn\u2019t. You just have to accept the people you know as your friends you can\u2019t just accept anyone and I 100 percent understand that some bad people are on the internet but young people this is how we talk and get to know each other. No one goes out on there bikes anymore and just knocks on there friend door and says hey mr or mrs who. It\u2019s not like that anymore. You can\u2019t trust your neighbors like you use to be able to. While I\u2019m not saying the internet is such a safe place either but people should just have some common sense and accept people that you only know. It\u2019s a fun app and parents doubt it a lot. I\u2019m on it 24/7 and I love the app I\u2019m just in love with it I\u2019ve had it since I was in 1st grade and you know what it was worth it. Get Snapchat but just be wise with your decisions or they will come back and bite you in the end always remember that!!!So Snapchat is an awesome app and I use it every day to talk to friends. Specifically through texting. I don\\'t use the actual camera aspect of the app much. However, the main reason for having Snapchat is to interact with friends through texting. But I feel we could make that even better, while bitmoji is a great way to express your emotions maybe we could add a drawing aspect to the chat. You would just be able to draw a photo and pin it to the chat instead of having to take a snap and draw a photo. Furthermore to make the texting aspect even better for Snapchat app developers can add the option to play message games. Like how iPhones have iMessage games for example 8 Ball. Crazy 8 (Uno). Checkers. 9 Ball, and 8 Ball+. Adding the option to play message games would help make the chats more interactive between the writers. This, in my opinion, is an idea that would help boost Snapchat\\'s already increasing number of users every day. Especially for people who get bored of just sending photos in texting. Plus I can already tell this is something that Instagram or any other social media application isn\\'t thinking about. While everyone is concerned with making the ability to post photos and videos better on their feed you Snapchat can easily upgrade your chatting/texting features. Considering the fact that everything else on this app seems to work just fine! Well, I hope that you app developers see this and put my idea into consideration for a future update.I really enjoy Snapchat. I use it for the majority of my communication with my friends. I have received the latest update and like so many other people I\u2019m not impressed. If you look at your reviews they have gone down from the last time I checked of at least three stars down to 1.8 stars. People are not happy and I think you need to realize that yes the Bitmoji\u2019s are great and we like them a lot but the update itself has gotten very confusing. I\u2019m the kind of person that only likes to look at my friends stories but I find myself always looking at people stories I don\u2019t care about simply because I\u2019m just tapping through. I also dislike the fact that when I go and see my Discover I see stories that I have already seen on my chat side. The text is gotten smaller and darker and it\u2019s hard for my vision. I would request that you would make it easier for people to see without having to make all of these changes just to see their Snapchat. I have you Snapchat for many years and have enjoyed it but this update is simply not good. There are some aspects that I like but stories on the same side as chat is not a good idea. However I would like to compliment you on the fact that you added more fonts however they take up a lot of space on my chat screen I would like to see them smaller or perhaps able to come up when I tap a button.
