I had uber take $128 that I had as credit and just keep it and not let me use it. Worst customer service ever. They are still holding on to it saying they can give it back to apply to a new account. Here\u2019s an update they email you about helping you then you respond and get told the email your responding with is not the same. The service is horrible and they don\u2019t do what\u2019s right for the customer. I\u2019ve tried many attempts to contact uber and they don\u2019t respond.
