I would absolutely love it if the developers could add a couple items to make it even more enjoyable and entertaining to use which could give it a better rating in the App Store. So first, everybody knows how hard it is to get the filter to actually go on your pets face because an animal face looks nothing like a human face. So what if there was a feature that the filters actually seek out an animals face? Like say when you go to one of the filters, there is an option; either human or animal and so you could easily get super cute, funny, or stylish filters on your already adorable animals. Secondly, this is kinda a copy off of Facebook, Instagram, etc. but Snapchat live. Like you could go live and people could see you real time just like Instagram, but make it to where you could use filters just like when you are video chatting with someone inside your personal chat or even in the group chats. This would make the app more interactive because the only way to get a message across to almost everyone is to send a picture to everyone in your contact list, or post it on your story where nobody gets notified if you actually post there(which is stupid and you should have an option to get notified when someone posts on their story).
