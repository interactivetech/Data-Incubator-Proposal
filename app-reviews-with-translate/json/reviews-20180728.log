Please change the app to what it was before and give us back the songs.

{"t": "28/Jul/2018:12:02:36 -07:00", "title": "I'm having issues on my Spotify...", "content": "First of all I want to thank you, Spotify, for taking action against R. Kelly and his crimes by removing his songs from all the playlists suggested to me. I really appreciate that. I also appreciate you making ways for me to remove singers that I don't care for, can't stand, and more importantly can't support due to their crimes of domestic violence and sexual assault from my homepage period. I feel much more free to eliminate the music from those I don't want to check out so I can finally listen to the music I DO want to check out. I finally have the freedom to listen to all the music I actually like without having to listen to music from people I don't like. So I thank you again for that. I would have given this app a five-star rating, but unfortunately there are a lot of issues I have w/ Spotify that's preventing me from doing that, which are: \n\n1) for the past two months I've been listening to music from the playlist suggested to me. Then all of a sudden in the middle of playing they repeated a song I just played a while ago, even though I was nowhere near finished with my playlist at all \n- I want to be able to listen to my playlist smoothly from the beginning all the way up to the end without certain tracks being repeated without my permission. \n\n2) another problem I have since Christmas time is when I'm playing music from a playlist, they would start playing songs that are NOT from the playlist at all! It happened the time I was listening to music from Mariah Carey's Christmas playlist Spotify made for me and Toni Braxton's new album Sex & Cigarettes when it first came out on April. Both of those times they played totally random songs that are NOT in the playlist and NOT in the album. \n- I DON'T want to hear songs that are NOT in the playlist and NOT in the album. I want to listen to songs that ARE on the playlist and ARE on the album. \n\n3) my homepage is super disorganized. Before they used to have the first line starting with Discover Weekly, Release Radar and my daily mixes, the second line with all the previous playlists and albums I listened to, the next lines the list of playlists based on what I listen to recently, and then the last lines the new released albums from different singers. Now my homepage is all over the place! Not only do they not have the new albums, but all the playlists are completely scattered everywhere. \n- I want my homepage to be neat and organized like it was from the beginning. I don't know why Spotify changed it without even me updating it at all. I like it when everything was organized for me. Look at TIDAL. Everything about TIDAL's homepage is neat and organized. If you make the Spotify homepage neat and organized like TIDAL, then I'll use it much more often. \n\n4) the time Christina Aguilera's Liberation album came out, I wanted to play the album thinking I would be able to listen to the entire album. Unfortunately the time I played the 15-track album, it only played just three songs and then all of a sudden it stopped completely. It happened to me not once but twice! \n- I want to listen to the whole album completely without any stops at all. \n\n5) I applauded Spotify for letting me choose which music from artists I don't want played. However I notice that you guys still promote music from singers I don't care for, even though I made it perfectly clear that I DON'T want to check out their music. The main example is when I choose not to want Teyana Taylor's music on my Spotify; yet two playlists Are & Be and The Newness kept shoving her music down my throat despite the fact the I made it perfectly clear that I don't want her music on my homepage! And it's not just Teyana Taylor. A lot of music from singers that I say I don't want on my Spotify STILL appear on the home pages of singers that I actually like and follow. Not only that but Spotify has the nerve to shove down playlists from singers I made clear I don't want to check out! \n- I only want to hear music from artists that I LIKE and artists that I FOLLOW.

The only way I will give Spotify a five-star rating IF AND ONLY IF they fix these issues I mentioned.", "title_en": "I'm having issues on my Spotify...", "content_en": "First of all I want to thank you, Spotify, for taking action against R. Kelly and his crimes by removing his songs from all the playlists suggested to me. I really appreciate that. I also appreciate you making ways for me to remove singers that I don't care for, can't stand, and more importantly can't support due to their crimes of domestic violence and sexual assault from my homepage period. I feel much more free to eliminate the music from those I don't want to check out so I can finally listen to the music I DO want to check out. I finally have the freedom to listen to all the music I actually like without having to listen to music from people I don't like. So I thank you again for that. I would have given this app a five-star rating, but unfortunately there are a lot of issues I have w/ Spotify that's preventing me from doing that, which are: \n\n1) for the past two months I've been listening to music from the playlist suggested to me. Then all of a sudden in the middle of playing they repeated a song I just played a while ago, even though I was nowhere near finished with my playlist at all \n- I want to be able to listen to my playlist smoothly from the beginning all the way up to the end without certain tracks being repeated without my permission. \n\n2) another problem I have since Christmas time is when I'm playing music from a playlist, they would start playing songs that are NOT from the playlist at all! It happened the time I was listening to music from Mariah Carey's Christmas playlist Spotify made for me and Toni Braxton's new album Sex & Cigarettes when it first came out on April. Both of those times they played totally random songs that are NOT in the playlist and NOT in the album. \n- I DON'T want to hear songs that are NOT in the playlist and NOT in the album. I want to listen to songs that ARE on the playlist and ARE on the album. \n\n3) my homepage is super disorganized. Before they used to have the first line starting with Discover Weekly, Release Radar and my daily mixes, the second line with all the previous playlists and albums I listened to, the next lines the list of playlists based on what I listen to recently, and then the last lines the new released albums from different singers. Now my homepage is all over the place! Not only do they not have the new albums, but all the playlists are completely scattered everywhere. \n- I want my homepage to be neat and organized like it was from the beginning. I don't know why Spotify changed it without even me updating it at all. I like it when everything was organized for me. Look at TIDAL. Everything about TIDAL's homepage is neat and organized. If you make the Spotify homepage neat and organized like TIDAL, then I'll use it much more often. \n\n4) the time Christina Aguilera's Liberation album came out, I wanted to play the album thinking I would be able to listen to the entire album. Unfortunately the time I played the 15-track album, it only played just three songs and then all of a sudden it stopped completely. It happened to me not once but twice! \n- I want to listen to the whole album completely without any stops at all. \n\n5) I applauded Spotify for letting me choose which music from artists I don't want played. However I notice that you guys still promote music from singers I don't care for, even though I made it perfectly clear that I DON'T want to check out their music. The main example is when I choose not to want Teyana Taylor's music on my Spotify; yet two playlists Are & Be and The Newness kept shoving her music down my throat despite the fact the I made it perfectly clear that I don't want her music on my homepage! And it's not just Teyana Taylor. A lot of music from singers that I say I don't want on my Spotify STILL appear on the home pages of singers that I actually like and follow. Not only that but Spotify has the nerve to shove down playlists from singers I made clear I don't want to check out! \n- I only want to hear music from artists that I LIKE and artists that I FOLLOW. When I make it perfectly clear that I don't want to hear music  from certain singers, DON'T keep shoving their music down my throat! When I say I don't want music from Halsey, don't shove the \"This Is Halsey\" playlist down my throat!

Ich nutzte daf\u00fcr immer gerne die M\u00f6glichkeit Filme und Serien downzuloaden sobald ich auf eine schnelle brandbreite zugriff hatte. Dies wurde jedoch durch ein Update unm\u00f6glich gemacht. Die Gr\u00fcnde hierf\u00fcr sind mir schleierhaft, immerhin ging es ja vorher immer mit Apple TV die offline Medien zu streamen. \nWie schrecklich muss es sein in jedem Downloader einen Kriminellen zu sehen, oder was ist hier der Grund f\u00fcr die \u00c4nderung? Was ist nur so schlimm daran das iPhone auf dem Fernseher anzeigen zu wollen um die Filme besser zu genie\u00dfen? Wenn ihr vielleicht noch mehr Geld machen wollt: wie w\u00e4re es mit einer Option sein Abo zu erweitern so das man die Inhalte wieder auf gr\u00f6\u00dfere Displays abspielen kann? Wenigstens w\u00e4re das ein Kompromiss um den Kunden mit wenig \u201eInternet\u201c ein wenig Freude im Netflix-Leben zu bereiten.

I always liked to download the possibility to download films and series as soon as I had access to a fast brand width. However, this was made impossible by an update. The reasons for this are beyond me, after all, it was always before with Apple TV to stream the offline media. How terrible must it be to see a criminal in any downloader, or what&#39;s the reason for the change? What is so bad about wanting to show the iPhone on the TV to enjoy the movies better? If you want to make even more money: how about an option to expand your subscription so that you can play the content back to larger displays?

"title_en": "registered", "content_en": "She can&#39;t register her in the county of Muxian, born in 1916. Her parents do rice business and have a carefree childhood. After the age of 20, she met a man and found that the other party was a rogue and chose to divorce after half a year. When she was 33, she met a chef and re-emerged the spark of love. After she got married again, she began a warm and warm worldly life. Later, her husband died and she lived alone. When she was young, she liked literature and loves to read. When I was fifty or sixty years old, I fell in love with dance. Reading satisfies her spiritual needs, and living alone has become enjoyment. The dance gave her a healthy body, and the age is only a number. She loves beauty, and her life is also lived and beautiful. The mirror and lipstick are always on the side, even if you don&#39;t go out, you will have a faint makeup in the morning. At the age of 92, she danced and sprained her waist. When her son saw that her mood was particularly depressed, she asked her to write poetry. Because she dreamed of writing poetry when she was young, her son\u2019s advice gave her great encouragement. When she saw her poetry published in the press, she was particularly happy and gave her the motivation to continue writing poetry. She kept writing and kept sending. In the fall of 2016, at the age of 98, she published the virgin poetry collection \u201cDon&#39;t Be Disheartened,\u201d which sold more than 1.5 million copies that year and entered the top ten best-selling books in Japan in 2016. To know that Japanese poetry books are small in print, generally only a few hundred copies are printed. She created the &quot;myth&quot; of Japanese poetry books. Her poetry is based on love, dreams and hopes, and is as warm as the sun. She is happy to write poetry, even poetry is full of passion. In the preface to &quot;Do not be discouraged&quot;, &quot;The Scriptures of the Book of War&quot; said in the preface to &quot;Don&#39;t Cry&quot;: &quot;As long as I see the poems of Shibata&#39;s mother-in-law, I feel as if I have a refreshing wind blowing my face.&quot; Her poetry reached a height. The height of life and life. At the beginning of 2016, she published the second collection of poems, &quot;Hundred Years Old,&quot; which has sold hundreds of thousands of copies. When the reporter asked her, did you realize that you were a hundred years old? The centenary poet Chai Neifeng joked and said: &quot;I didn&#39;t care about my age when I wrote poetry. I saw that I was 100 years old when I read a good book.&quot; She is so optimistic. A person has lived alone for more than 20 years. He has heard many tragicomedy in the world and watched himself approach death. At 100, she is still full of hope and said to herself: Hello/what is unfortunate/what is good? /Sunshine and breeze have never been eccentric / everyone / can dream equally / I have also / sad things / but live really happy / you do not be discouraged. She is Chai Neifeng, a Japanese ordinary wife. Because of her dream of writing poetry, before the age of 90, she was obscured. After the age of 90, she became famous and achieved brilliant achievements.

Since he started practicing fencing in high school, he was short-listed for the 1980 Moscow Olympics, which was boycotted by Japan. He is physically strong, muscular and physically fit. And the fencing professor fell in love, but the other person was suffering from cancer, and there was not much left. I am entangled in participating in intensive training to realize my dreams, or to accompany my boyfriend to love, to come to consult. In the end, I participated in the training and also saw the last side of my boyfriend. Due to my ability to be eliminated in the qualification trials, I missed the Olympics without regrets and was able to face the future positively. I was a neighbor with the Tamura family, and I was introduced to the Wagner grocery store. &quot;Fish shop musician&quot; (fish house \u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3) Matsuoka Krone, the author of the second consultation letter received by the thief trio. I hope to become a creative professional singer. I dropped out of the economics college of a university in Tokyo, but I have been in Tokyo for three years because I have no music talent. Because her grandmother died, her father was weak, and she was the only child. She was asked to inherit the fish shop named &quot;Fishong&quot; in her home. I don&#39;t know how to choose a letter consultation. I wanted to inherit the fish shop under the advice of the three men of Dun, but the father of the understanding was asked to go to Tokyo to fight hard. On the night of December 24, 1988, when he made a Christmas condolence performance to Maruguang Park, he encountered a fire and died to save the original water. He suffered serious burns and died in the hospital. After the water, the raw celery is sung by the representative of &quot;Rebirth&quot;. &quot;Green River&quot; (\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc) Chuanbian Green, pregnant with a woman with a husband, decided to give birth to her daughter alone after consulting with the wave, and unfortunately the car accident passed away. The daughter was adopted by Maruyama Park and became the agent of the water parsley. She wrote a letter to the grocery store of the &quot;Green River&#39;s Daughter&quot;. &quot;Paul Lennon&quot; (\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30ec\u30ce\u30f3) and Jiu Haosuke, who are well-off, are fans of the Beatles. However, the news that the father company\u2019s debts decided to abscond and the Beatles disbanded had stimulated him. He had been alienated from his heart and consulted with Mr. Yoshio, which was the first serious consultation received by Xiongzhi. On the way to absconding, he left his parents, the pseudonym &quot;Fujikawa Bo&quot;, and he turned to Maru Kwok Park and became a woodcarver. He still decided to thank Mr. Nakao Yoshiji after learning that his parents had fled. &quot;The lost dog&quot; (the scorpion dog) Muto Harumi, the author of the third consultation letter received by the thief trio. I want to quit my job as a full-time wine house girl, and then I will open a store. For this pseudonym &quot;a lost puppy&quot;, I would like to send a letter to the Langya grocery store. After the thief trio learned about her real thoughts of earning money, she described her future economic trends in Japan and proposed a proposal to get rich, making Qingmei step by step become the president of a large company.

After a few glasses of wine, the two talked about the situation after graduation. Hangzi said that he had a previous experience of entrepreneurial failure. I heard it, I didn\u2019t hear you mention it before. The carrier said with a smile, the past is unbearable. Hangzi said that he had just graduated from a very young age and always wanted to do something big, so he borrowed a sum of money from his family and went to Shenzhen alone to start a business. Because it was the first time to start a business, no experience, the carrier chose a fruit trade that is easier to get started. It sells apples and sells them from Gansu to local supermarkets and dealers. Entrepreneurship is really bitter. During that time, the voyager has to go out with the sales every day to run the business. It is common to go back at 2 or 3 in the morning every day. I often have to accompany the customers to drink alcohol. The amount of the voyage is not good. When I entered the hospital, I got a bite on the battlefield the next day... Don&#39;t say, after a year, the company bumped into the road and survived fortunately. But the good times didn&#39;t last long. One client of the voyage gave him a big list, and he wanted 10 tons of apples at a time. The carrier was particularly happy, and encountered such a large list for the first time. When the result is delivered, the customer repents and says no. The aviator looked at the apple in the big warehouse, and almost collapsed. The weather in Shenzhen is hot, and Apple&#39;s time is not long. He can only go to a supermarket, the fruit shop asks the past, and tries every means to solve the stranded goods as soon as possible. But with more grandchildren, and said a lot of good things, the company still lost a lot of money. Hangzi said that he did not drop a tear when he drank and went to the hospital, but he saw the company go down a little bit. He cried. He felt that he had failed especially. I am sorry to follow the staff who worked hard all the way. I am sorry to do my best to support him. parents. During that time, he went home with a heavy pace every morning, and there were vehicles passing by on the street. Everyone was quiet, but no one could help him. He felt so sleepy, tired, and wanted to leave. . But he knows no, really can&#39;t! The company still has a lot of things waiting for him to deal with, he can&#39;t fall. The voyage slammed a sip of wine: unfortunately, the company finally went bankrupt. His voice, a sigh of relief in the free and easy.

Mr. Ye Guoyou, the expert leader from the International Rice Research Institute, announced that the five varieties of YCLJ59, YCYJ48, YCRN4H, YCSTU9712 and YCLJ58 have a production output of 7.8041 tons/ha, 7.4106 tons/ha, 7.3076 tons/ha and 5.952 tons. /ha and 4.8266 tons / hectare, these varieties exceed the average mu yield of 4.539 tons / hectare of rice worldwide (from the 2014 FAO statistics). In the following period of time, the sea rice team separately measured the mature varieties and obtained four varieties that exceeded the average yield per mu in the world. This marks the staged success of the sea rice team in the trial planting of sea rice in the desert area of \u200b\u200bDubai.", "id": "2983688220", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "5", "version": "182.0", "author": "\u6492\u64ad woman \u6211\u5462\u6309\u6469", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Facebook"}

In 1931, West Endheim, Belgium, the penniless British young composer Robert Frobisher experienced a lot of love and hate under the music master. [3] In 1975, in Denis, California, the tabloid journalist Louisa Ray took great risks to investigate corruption and murder in nuclear power plant projects. At the beginning of the 21st century, Timothy Cavendish, the publisher of the British murdered by the underworld, was placed under house arrest in a nursing home. In the future of the anti-Utopia era, Nesuo State, Song Kee Restaurant clone waiter Xingmei-451 resisted the society that created and exploited the cloned group. In the future, in the future, Hawaii, the shepherd boy who lost his father, Zakri and the survivors of high-tech civilization will meet unexpectedly.

It\u2019s too hard to be in a long distance relationship. If you can\u2019t talk about a long distance relationship, try not to talk about it. 2. Feelings need restraint, it is not appropriate to use too much force, too strong love will only make you lose the charm that makes him (her) heart. 3. The problem you worried about at the beginning of love will eventually become a problem that really hinders you. 4. When you feel that everything is taken for granted, it is often the eve of the storm. 5. Feelings are what you want, no one owes money, but it is like multiplication, one side is zero, and all are lost. 6. Pure touch is not love, lovers are not your emotional trash can, sharing happiness is always more important than catharsis. 7. Love is not the whole of life, it should not be the center of gravity of your world. You still have a lot of meaningful things to do. 8. No one in the relationship who owes money, no one can not be separated from anyone, time is always the best medicine. 9. After separation, I hope that you will live better than anyone else, and hope that you will never know. 10. A good relationship should be based on the heart of trust, not restricting the freedom of the other party, and not cherishing the freedom of the cherished heart. 11.

Two years ago, the EU accepted the idea of \u200b\u200bincreasing the import of liquid natural gas. But whether it is measured by price or quantity, it is impossible for US liquid natural gas to compete with Russia. The natural gas supplied by Russia is pipeline natural gas, which is safe and stable. Trump said in front of the media that &quot;liquid natural gas can help the EU&quot;, and it is only borrowing the arguments that the EU has said before. In 2017, liquid natural gas also accounted for less than 10% of the world&#39;s natural gas supply. The International Petroleum Alliance lobby said that in the liquid natural gas market, US competitors are mainly low-priced suppliers, such as Africa and Australia. But the prices offered by these countries are almost half that of the United States. An EU official attending the summit pointed out that the words used by the two leaders in the joint statement are that the EU \u201cwanted\u201d to buy more LNG with the United States.
