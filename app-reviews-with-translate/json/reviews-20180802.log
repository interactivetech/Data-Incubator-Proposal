The picture and style of the Chinese style and the dubbing of the first chapter of the plot are very attractive to me. Of course, I hope to be more advanced. Maybe for research and development funding or client considerations? But as a continuation of the classics, I hope that these things can be perfected. I like the game to be humanized. The gameplay, especially the player&#39;s interaction, feels great. The game is very good, thanks to the game that brings happiness and relaxation to my life. One thing that feels like cooking in the game, the buns made should be quality, although small things, but the details determine success or failure. Unlike other games, it is probably that this game is full of friendship. Every day, communicating with friends and sisters makes the character not just a singer but our true feelings. This is the best brand image of the brand and product innovation ability. These are the extent of our damage... You go to bed early... Do you have dinner at home? I can&#39;t live at home to see the house. It&#39;s been such an hour. I can&#39;t live at home. I also feel happy or miserable. Is this weather still like??! You said that you have time! These people do have problems...they are developing their confidence index for the future development direction. Because the original version is not finished, I have seen the Raiders. I understand that it is basically a bit boring, although it is a game, but I think it is in terms of mode. I should add some interesting things. For example, the frog I raised went out to travel. Basically, in addition to sending back postcards or coming back, I suggested that you can add a communication method. We can use this communication mode during the frog outbound tour. The frog gets in touch and knows where he is with whom he will not be silently waiting for it to come back. You can do some interactions during the communication. For example, you can develop a small program that sends dry food and four leaves* remotely. When you communicate with it, you know that it doesn&#39;t want to come back. At this time, the dry food is not enough. You can send the dry food to the collection and hunting of the game copy through the remote sending program. Naturally, you can see the shadow of the monster hunter, but the game is simplified. Part of the hunter of the monster hunter adds a lot of unique elements to make the tour The play has a completely new look. Both the veteran and the newcomer can experience the magical fighting fun and feel the idyllic life. The game&#39;s position, the release of skills has a strong sense, plus some The new system, such as the breeding and development of horses, the type of sorcerer stunts and the training and synergy of the upgraded characters, have become the driving force for players to actively explore and explore, and are currently very satisfied with the overall quality of the game. A rare good game, in addition to being touched, must pay tribute to the staff of the production team. They have never interrupted this kind of effort, and we are really hard to attack.

I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t barely maintain a whole night. Work hard! I have to pay attention to it too! These things are really great! Can&#39;t help but don&#39;t understand.

I worry that my vulgar language will tarnish the rare talks in this world. But I still replied, because I feel that if I can&#39;t leave my footprints behind such wonderful talks, it will be a regret for my life. Please forgive my selfishness!

It\u2019s such a cheap price for so many good movies, and don\u2019t forget that it\u2019s the only thing that keeps me quiet on road trips. I think that Netflix is SO MUCH better then those copiers like Hulu, Sling, and YouTube Red/TV. Even on Sling, you can only watch live shows, unless you spend MORE money on DVR capability, and I\u2019m guessing that you have to pay more money for more storage, or have limited storage, on the $6 DVR that you had to buy on top of the $35.99 you spent for a month of streaming from only 20+ channels, and you don\u2019t know what half of them are. What\u2019s even better about Netflix is that the $14.99 version is Ultra HD, and HD, at least. Not to mention it\u2019s also the most expensive plan, even though it cheaper than any other TV service EVER. \n\nI forgot to mention the Download feature! If you have a limited data plan, or no Internet Service Providers(ISP), you can turn on \u2018Only WiFi Downloads\u2019 in the very accessible settings and download all of the shows AND movies you love to watch, and take them with you on a road trip. Usually (at least for me), I download more episodes than I actually watch. Instead of searching through customer support or Googling \u2018Netflix for Dummies\u2019 to find a way to remove it, just go to (second time I said it) easily accessible settings and delete the shows.\n\nThe only, only, ONLY complaint I have is that the show, \u2018Hitler\u2019s Bodyguard\u2019, doesn\u2019t show up under \u2018Recently Watched\u2019 or \u2018My List\u2019, even though I quintuple check that it was added to my list and was watched for a whole episode\u2014 and more.

Why can not you decide on a function who wants to see what? And above all, whether sorted by date or by &quot;importance&quot;.

"title_en": "registered", "content_en": "On January 30, 1889, the 23-year-old Yeats met the beautiful actress Mao Degang for the first time. She was 22 years old and was the daughter of a British colonel in Ireland. Not long ago. Her father inherited a large legacy after his death. Mood Gang is not only beautiful, but also beautiful and moving. Moreover, after feeling the tragic situation of the Irish people being oppressed by the British, she began to sympathize with the Irish people and resolutely gave up the social life of Dublin\u2019s upper class and devoted herself to the independence of the Irish nation. Come in the sport and become one of the leaders. This added a special halo to Mao Degang in the mind of Yeats. [1] Yeats fell in love with Mao Degang at first sight, and he was deeply in love. Ye Zhi described his first encounter with Mao Degang: &quot;She stood by the window and was surrounded by a large group of apple blossoms; Glimmering, as if it were a petal filled with sunlight.\u201d Ye Zhi deeply loves her, but she is hopeless because of the noble image she formed in his mind. Young Yeats feels that she is \u201cimmature and lacks achievement\u201d. &quot;So, although the relationship is afflicting him, he has not yet confessed her, one is because of shame, and the other is because she thinks she can&#39;t marry a poor student.&quot; Mao Degang has been arrogant about Ye Zhi. In July 1891, Ye Zhi misunderstood the information she gave her a letter, thinking that she had made a hint of love for herself, and immediately rushed to the first time. Mao Degang proposed marriage. She refused, saying that she could not marry him, but hoped to maintain friendship with Yeats. Since then, Mao Degang has always rejected the pursuit of Yeats. She married the Irish officer Major McBride in 1903. The marriage was quite twisted and even catastrophic, but she was very stubborn. She refused Yeats\u2019 pursuit even when her marriage was completely frustrated. Despite this, Yeats\u2019s love for her life is not awkward, so the pain that is difficult to resolve is full of Yeat\u2019s life for a long time. [1] Yeats has been waiting, even though his Italians are already the wife of others, until the age of 52. That is, after Mao Degang, who had already died, refused Yeats\u2019s proposal again. After Ye Zhi\u2019s proposal to ask Isabella\u2019s daughter Isabella to be rejected, Yeats finally stopped this hopeless thought. But in fact, Yeats still can&#39;t forget Mao Degang. In the last few months of his life, he wrote a letter to Maidegan, asking her to come out for tea, but she was still rejected. Moreover, Mao Degang also refused to participate in his funeral. Yeats\u2019s pain and misfortune for the hopelessness of Mao Degang\u2019s love prompted Ye Zhi to write a lot of poems for Mao Degang. In decades, from various angles, Mao Degang Constantly inspiring Yeats\u2019 creative inspiration; sometimes it\u2019s exciting", "id": "3006445529", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "5", "version": "183.0", "author": "\uff1a\uff09-\uff08\uff1b", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Facebook"}

when you become a spiritual totem, you will be ruined by Sansheng III. If you are unfortunately a living person, you must be careful to be ruined. The Tao is talking about the house, and the Buddha is talking about it. Do you know what difference they have? No, there is no difference between the two words. There are two more words. The troubles of the sea are thousands of feet, the floating eucalyptus flowers are in full bloom, and the white flower buds are swaying in the rain. Not everyone can hang the pain in the face, even if it is not hanging on the face, the pain is a lot of points. Don&#39;t let yourself be so tired in order to cater to everyone, try your best to make everyone happy, and you will forget how you should laugh. Life is purely accidental, so each life must be attached to another life, dependent on each other, and go hand in hand. Life is purely accidental, so each life does not belong to another life, like a gust of wind, no concern, if others are willing to be close, do not want to be alone, take a long-distance passenger plane, sleep in the forbidden place, still love your precious touch. In the place, can I go far? Flying black and white film endings, the perfect person to leave, the most sad, how much can&#39;t afford to love, my heart, my mystery, my suspicion, I don&#39;t know how to crack, I am willing to break into the endless soft mud, I am willing to break into the bottom, I feel like a fascinating landscape, but suddenly I am sluggish. In the end of the world, if I believe that God is exiled, I am afraid of deviant. I seem to be rejected by the world. I can\u2019t hug for a moment. I am afraid that I will be afraid of one second and one second. If others are willing to be close, I don\u2019t want to be alone. Long-distance passenger planes are still in love. Valuable touch in the place, can I go high, fly black and white, the perfect ending, the most sad, the most sad, how much, the love, the master, the blog, the fact that you buried me, the dazzling victory of God, the punishment, the grievance, the grievance, the humble, the humble It seems that the world often abandons it and can&#39;t hug a moment to fall in love. When you don&#39;t remember, if you meet me, if you don&#39;t trim the edge, it&#39;s like a heavy killing. The dejected and precious touch is in the place. I really want to be saddened by the people who are living in the love game. I am so sad that I once believed in the sea and stone as a symbol of eternal immortality. Later, I know that the sea is actually very easy to dry, stone, original Very easy to rot. Rain, it is very likely that it will not come again, the sea will not become a mulberry. It turns out that the earth that is stepping on under your feet can easily be destroyed. The eternal death of the sea and the dead stone did not exist. Perhaps the people around you are not your favorite, but the inevitability and accidental acceptance of life is perhaps the leisure of life, some fate is destined to be missed, and some love is destined to be lost!
