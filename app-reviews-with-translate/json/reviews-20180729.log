It\u2019s really great. It feels good overall! The picture and style of the Chinese style and the dubbing of the first chapter of the plot are very attractive to me. Of course, I hope to be more advanced. Maybe for research and development funding or client considerations? But as a continuation of the classics, I hope that these things can be perfected. I like the game to be humanized. The gameplay, especially the player&#39;s interaction, feels great. The game is very good, thanks to the game that brings happiness and relaxation to my life. One thing that feels like cooking in the game, the buns made should be quality, although small things, but the details determine success or failure. Unlike other games, it is probably that this game is full of friendship. Every day, communicating with friends and sisters makes the character not just a singer but our true feelings. This is the best brand image of the brand and product innovation ability. These are the extent of our damage... You go to bed early... Do you have dinner at home? I can&#39;t live at home to see the house. It&#39;s been such an hour. I can&#39;t live at home. I also feel happy or miserable. Is this weather still like??! You said that you have time! These people do have problems...they are developing their confidence index for the future development direction. Because the original version is not finished, I have seen the Raiders. I understand that it is basically a bit boring, although it is a game, but I think it is in terms of mode. I should add some interesting things. For example, the frog I raised went out to travel. Basically, in addition to sending back postcards or coming back, I suggested that you can add a communication method. We can use this communication mode during the frog outbound tour. The frog gets in touch and knows where he is with whom he will not be silently waiting for it to come back. You can do some interactions during the communication. For example, you can develop a small program that sends dry food and four leaves* remotely. When you communicate with it, you know that it doesn&#39;t want to come back. At this time, the dry food is not enough. You can send the dry food to the collection and hunting of the game copy through the remote sending program. Naturally, you can see the shadow of the monster hunter, but the game is simplified. Part of the hunter of the monster hunter adds a lot of unique elements to make the tour The play has a completely new look. Both the veteran and the newcomer can experience the magical fighting fun and feel the idyllic life. The game&#39;s position, the release of skills has a strong sense, plus some New systems such as the breeding and development of horses, the type of sorcerer stunts and the training and synergy of the upgraded characters have become the driving force for players to actively explore and explore the fragrance. At present, they are very satisfied with the overall quality of the game. In addition to moving a rare good game, you must pay tribute to the staff of the production team.", "id": "2990404088", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "5", "version": "13.29", "author": "\u864e\u523a\u6885\ud83d\udea8\ud83c\udfa2", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Youtube"}

The ceremony expressed infinite grief to the compatriots who died in the earthquake and paid high tribute to the heroes who died in the earthquake relief. Wang Hao, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, Ding Xiufeng, Mayor of the Municipal People&#39;s Congress, Guo Yanhong, Director of the Standing Committee of the Municipal People&#39;s Congress, Cao Zhengping, Chairman of the CPPCC, and Ding Rongjin, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, and other leaders of the city&#39;s four major groups, attended the ceremony. Ding Xiufeng presided over the ceremony. In the early morning, in the Memorial Site of the Earthquake Site, the masses who came to pay homage to their loved ones and rely on the dying were incessant. The flowers were sacrificed in front of the earthquake memorial wall, and the music &quot;Thinking&quot; turned low and the atmosphere was exceptionally solemn. At 8:30, the ceremony of dedication to the flower basket began. Accompanied by the soothing and affectionate &quot;Flower of the Flower&quot;, the two armed police rituals lifted the flower baskets with the words &quot;Dedication to the Tangshan Earthquake and the heroes who died in the earthquake relief&quot;, and placed the baskets in the earthquake. The martyrs commemorate the wall. Wang Hao looked solemn and steady, and carefully arranged the sash on the flower basket. Subsequently, all stood up and mourned for a minute to the heroes of the Tangshan earthquake and the heroes who died in the earthquake relief. After the silence, the people from all walks of life who came spontaneously greeted the flowers in front of the memorial wall, remembering the dead and paying homage to the spirit.", "id": "2987770912", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "5", "version": "55.0", "author": "\u4f60\u59b9\u4f60\u59b9\u7684123", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Instagram"}

After reading this sentence one by one, my heart can&#39;t be calm and shocked for a long time! Why is there such a good talk! I have been in the QQ space for many years, and I thought that there would be no more talks that would touch me. I didn\u2019t expect to see such a subtle statement today. It is you who let me deeply understand the phrase &#39;there are people outside, there are days outside the sky&#39;. thank you! After reading this, I didn&#39;t respond immediately, because I was afraid that my vulgar response would tarnish the rare space of this space. But I still replied, because I feel that if I can&#39;t leave my footprints behind such wonderful talks, then I will not be afraid of death! How proud it is to be able to leave behind your own footprints after such a wonderful talk! Please forgive my selfishness! I know that no matter how gorgeous the rhetoric is used to describe the wonderfulness of the landlord, it is not enough, it is hypocritical, so I just want to say: Your talk is very good! I am willing to watch it all my life!

That winter, my grandmother died, and my father\u2019s messenger was also handed over. It\u2019s a bad day. I went from Beijing to Xuzhou and planned to go home with my father. When I saw my father in Xuzhou, I saw the things that were full of things in the courtyard, and I remembered my grandmother, and I could not help but shed tears. The father said, &quot;This is already the case. You don&#39;t have to be sad. Fortunately, there is no way to heaven!&quot; When he went home to sell the classics, his father lost the money; he borrowed money to do the funeral. These days, the situation in the home is very bleak, half for the funeral, and half for the father. After the funeral was over, my father had to go to Nanjing to seek a job. I also had to go back to Beijing to study, and we walked together. When I arrived in Nanjing, some friends went to wander around and stayed for one day. On the second morning, I had to cross the river to Pukou and go to the north in the afternoon. The father was busy because of the matter. He had already said that he would not send me, and asked a well-known tea house in the hotel to accompany me. He went to the tea house again and again, very carefully. But he finally did not trust, afraid that the tea room was not properly posted; quite a while. In fact, I was already twenty years old, and Beijing has been there two or three times. It doesn&#39;t matter. He took a moment and finally decided to send it to me. I advised him two or three times that he didn&#39;t have to go; he only said, &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter, they don&#39;t go well!&quot; We crossed the river and entered the station. I bought a ticket and he was busy looking after the luggage. Too much baggage, you have to make some tips to the porter before you can pass. He is busy talking to them about the price. I was so smart at the time, I always felt that he was not very beautiful, and he couldn\u2019t interrupt himself. But he finally settled the price; just sent me on the bus. He gave me a chair by the door; I laid the seat of the purple fur coat that he gave me. He told me to be careful on the road, wake up at night, don&#39;t get cold. I also took care of the tea room. I laughed at his embarrassment in my heart; they only recognized the money and asked them to be white! And people of my age, can&#39;t you cook yourself? Oh, I think about it now, it was so smart at the time! I said, &quot;Dad, let&#39;s go.&quot; He looked out of the car and said, &quot;I bought a few oranges. You are here, don&#39;t move.&quot; I see a few outside the fence on the platform. Waiting for customers to sell things. Going over to the platform, you have to cross the railway, you have to jump and climb up. The father is a fat man, and it takes a lot of trouble to go. I was going to go, he refused, so he had to go. I saw him wearing a black cloth cap, wearing a black cloth big horse, a dark blue cotton robes, walking to the side of the railway, and slowly looking down, it is not difficult. But he crossed the railway and it was not easy to climb the platform there. He climbed the top with both hands and his feet curled up again; his obese body tilted slightly to the left, showing a hard-working look. Then I saw his back and my tears flowed down quickly. I quickly wiped away the tears, afraid that he would see it, and I was afraid that others would see it. When I looked out again, he had already taken the red orange and looked back. When crossing the railway, he first scattered the oranges on the ground, slowly climbed down, and then picked up the oranges. When I got here, I quickly went to marry him. He and I went to the car and put the oranges on my fur coat. So I rushed to the dirt on my clothes, and my heart was very relaxed. After a while, I said, &quot;I am leaving; I will come over there!&quot; I looked at him and went out. He took a few steps and looked back at me and said, &quot;Go in, there is no one inside.&quot; Waiting for his back to mix in with people coming and going, I can&#39;t find it again, I will come in and sit down, my tears come again. It is. In recent years, my father and I have been running around, and the home is not as good as one day. He was a teenager who went out to make a living, supported him alone, and did many great things. That knows the old world is so sloppy! He is so sad that he can&#39;t help himself. The mood is in the middle, naturally it is to be sent out; the family trivial often touches his anger. He treated me differently. But after two years of disappearance, he finally forgot my bad, just remembering me and thinking about my son. After I came north, he wrote a letter to me. The letter said, &quot;I am safe, but my arms are so painful. I have a lot of inconvenience, and I am not far away.&quot; I read here. In the tears of crystal, I saw the back of the obese, blue cotton robes and black cloth horses. Ugh! I don&#39;t know when I can meet him again!", "id": "2989532408", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "5", "version": "182.0", "author": "\u89c5\u9047\u4e36", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Facebook"}

Since the latest update about a week ago Waze consistently gives the message that it fails to communicate to the routing server. When it does connect it doesn\u2019t recognize some major roads as roads any longer. For example I drive the same way to work every day and always have Waze on and for whatever reason in the last few days if I\u2019m on a certain highway it doesn\u2019t even acknowledge it as a road. And it won\u2019t give the road as an option even when I am on the road. It\u2019s as if certain roads don\u2019t exist in Waze\u2019s mind anymore. I\u2019ve also noticed that some spoken directions are coming extremely last minute. I will literally be passing an exit and Waze says take the exit. I\u2019m not sure if this was an intentional thing but it is completely dangerous and really unhelpful especially when you are using it to follow directions on lesser-known roads and need to know exactly where to turn. Anyway, I use this app every day whether I know where I\u2019m going or not and this update has been extremely disappointing so far. Hopefully it will get fixed soon.\n\n(Review 3) Everything below still stands - I recommend this app to everyone. I haven't noticed the \"last minute route change\" that people are commenting on in some reviews - mine are always in plenty of time. But I did take off one star because the planned trips feature, while generally awesome, won't let me plan and save a trip for the next day even though that is an option they offer. It just spins and spins until I close the app. In this area - with crazy traffic - it would be extremely helpful if that option actually worked the way it is supposed to. \n\n(Review 2) Update.

I can imagine that it works the best if a lot of people are using it in a certain area, that is kind of the point after all for people to update in real time, but I live in a heavily populated area and it is great. The only thing I wish is that you could choose to not hear specific hazards - you have the option to turn hazard notifications off but not the option to pick which ones you want to hear. I live in a large town outside of a large city so you can imagine they're always cars stopped on the side of the road etc. and it can get terribly annoying when every 20 seconds there is a \"vehicle stopped on shoulder ahead\" hazard warning. Every time there has been an issue with a direction or a map, which happens very infrequently, someone from their customer service has gotten back to me quickly after I made the report - that is such a huge thing with these driving directions apps, so many of them don't fix the issues with the map even after you report it over and over again. I have found that nine times out of ten Waze has been right on that. I love the fact that you can add stops along your route and that it lets you know how far out of the way it is, I love the \"planned drives\" option that gives you the best idea of when to leave to arrive on time, there are just some great features in this app. I definitely recommend it.", "title_en": "I love this app!

Every time there has been an issue with a direction or a map, which happens very infrequently, someone from their customer service has gotten back to me quickly after I made the report - that is such a huge thing with these driving directions apps, so many of them don't fix the issues with the map even after you report it over and over again. I have found that nine times out of ten Waze has been right on that. I love the fact that you can add stops along your route and that it lets you know how far out of the way it is, I love the \"planned drives\" option that gives you the best idea of when to leave to arrive on time, there are just some great features in this app. I definitely recommend it.", "id": "2988459354", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "2", "version": "4.41.2", "author": "Tilliebird", "country": "US", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Waze"}
