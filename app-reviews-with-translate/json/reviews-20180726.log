The teacher, so the evangelism is also confusing. People who are not born to know, can you be confused? Do not confuse the teacher, it is confusing, and ultimately does not solve. Before I was born, my voice was also pre-emptive, and I was a teacher. After I was born, my voice was also before me. My teacher also said, Fu Yong knows that his years have been born to me? It is therefore not expensive, no long, no less, the existence of the Tao, the teacher&#39;s existence. Almost! It\u2019s been a long time for the teacher to pass it! It\u2019s hard to be tempted by people! The ancient saints, who are far away from the people, still ask from the teacher; the people of today, the saints under them are also far away, and shame to learn. It is the reason of Saint Yisheng, Yuyiyu. The reason why the sage is holy, the fool is so stupid, is it all? Love his son, choose to teach and teach; in his body, it is shameful, confused. The teacher of the boy&#39;s son, who gave the book and learned the sentence readers, is not the so-called passer-by to explain its confusing. I don&#39;t know the sentence, I don&#39;t know what to do, or I don&#39;t know what to do, or I don&#39;t know what to do. The witch doctor is a person who is not a shameful teacher. The family of the scholar-officials, the priests and the disciples of the disciples, gather together and laugh. Asked, then he said: &quot;He is similar to the other year, and the road is similar. The level is humble, and the official is near.&quot; The teacher\u2019s path is beyond recognition. The Witch Doctor is a man of the sorcerer&#39;s work. The gentleman is not a tooth. Today, his wisdom is impossible, and it can be blamed! The sage is impermanent. Confucius teacher, son, son, teacher, and old man. The scorpion is not as good as Confucius. Confucius: Threesome, there must be my teacher. Therefore, the disciples do not have to be as good as the teacher. The teacher does not have to be a disciple, and he has a good command, and the profession has a specialization. Li Shizi, the seventeenth year, the good ancient Chinese, the six art classics are all learned, regardless of time, learn Yu Yu.

It is said that there is no sin, and that it is a sinless sin; it is still being slain, and that it is still coming back! \u59be\u6709\u7ee3\u8170\u8966, \u8473(w\u0113i)\u8564(ru\u00ed) self-generated light; Four-pointed sachets; box curtains sixty or seventy, green and blue silk ropes, the objects are different, all kinds of species in them. People are also shackles, not enough to welcome the future, leaving for the remains (w\u00e8i) Shi, there is no reason for this. Always for comfort, for a long time, don&#39;t forget!&quot; The cock is screaming, and the bride is wearing makeup. I embroidered the skirt, everything goes four or five. Under the foot ni (ni\u00e8) silk, head \u73b3 (d\u00e0i) \u7441 (m\u00e0o) light. If the waist is a sputum, the ear will be covered with a bright moon (d\u0101ng). Refers to the roots of the onions, such as Zhu Dan. The fine fiber is a fine step, and it is unparalleled in the world. On the church, I\u2019m aunt, and my mother is angry. &quot;When I was a daughter, I was born out of the wild. I had no lessons, and I was a servant of my family. I was driven by my mother\u2019s money, and I was too hard to drive. I still go home today, and I am going to work at home.&quot; Even beads. &quot;When the bride first came, Xiaogu began to help the bed; today was driven, Xiaogu is like me. Diligently raising the public, I will help myself. The seventh and the next nine, play and forget.&quot; Going out to board, \u6d95More than a hundred lines. The house horse is in front and the bride is in the back. It\u2019s faintly fascinating. When I got into the car, I bowed my head and whispered: &quot;The oath is not separated from each other, and I will go home for the time being; I will go to the house today, and I will return it soon. The oath is not the same!&quot; The new woman said that the house is: &quot;Thinking in the district!&quot; If the king sees the record, he will soon come to see the king. The king will be treated as a p\u00e1n stone, as a puppet, a puppet will be like a silk, and a meteorite will not be transferred. I have a brother-in-law, sexual violence, thunder I mean, reverse to fry my arms.&quot; Raise your hands and work hard, and love each other. Getting started on the house, advancing and retreating without a face. A mother is a big man, not a self-return: &quot;Thirteen teachings, fourteen can cut clothes, fifteen bombs, sixteen ceremonies, seventeen swearing, saying that there is no swearing. , do not welcome to return?&quot; Lange \u60ed A mother: &quot;Children are not guilty.&quot; A mother was greatly saddened. After returning home for more than ten days, the county magistrate sent media. The cloud has a third lang, and it is unparalleled in the world. At the beginning of the 18th year of the year, it was pi\u00e1n. A mother said that the woman said: &quot;You can go to it.&quot; A woman with tears answered: &quot;When Lang Chi was still in the early days, the house saw Ding Ning, and he vowed not to leave. Today, it is illegal to say that this is not a strange thing. Since the letter can be broken &quot;Xu&#39;s white matchmakers:&quot; &quot;Auntie has this woman, and it is still suitable for the family. It is unbearable to marry a woman, and it is a good match for Lang Jun? Fortunately, it can be widely consulted, and it is not allowed to agree.&quot; The matchmaker went for a few days. I am also looking for a place to ask for a return, saying that there are Lanjia women, and there are eunuchs in the country. The cloud has a fifth lang, and Jiaoyi is not married. Deportation is a matchmaker, and the main book passes the language. Straight to say that the family is too guarded, and this makes Lang Jun, who wants to make a big difference, so he is sent to your door. A mother Xie matchmaker: &quot;The woman has an oath first, the old man dare to speak!&quot; A brother heard it, and suddenly worried. It is said that Amei: &quot;Why don&#39;t you count! Let&#39;s marry the house first, then marry the lord, or (p\u01d0) Tairu Tiandi, enough to be honored. Don&#39;t marry the righteous body, what is the future?&quot; Langzhi raised his head and said: &quot;Let&#39;s be like a brother&#39;s word. Thanks to the family&#39;s husband, the middle of the road is still the brother&#39;s door. The punishment is appropriate for the brothers, that is to be self-appointed! Although the house is to be (y\u0101o), the canal will never have a chance. And, you can make a marriage.&quot; The matchmaker gets out of bed, Novoord. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Baifujun: &quot;The lower officials are on the mission, and the talks are very good.&quot; The palace has heard it, and the heart is happy. It is convenient to reopen the book, and it is convenient for this month. On the 30th day of Liangji, today is twenty-seven, and Qing can go to marriage. The slogan is fast, and the hustle and bustle is like a cloud. The blue-and-white pheasant [f\u01ceng], the four-horned dragon scorpion. Dina turned with the wind, Jin Cheyu made a round.\u8e2f(zh\u00ed)\u8e85(zh\u00fa) \u9752\u9aa2(c\u014dng) horse, tassel gold \u9542 saddle.\u8d4d(j\u012b) Three million yuan of money, all worn with blue silk. Three hundred variegated, Jiaozuo City (xi\u00e9) Jane. From four or five hundred people, Yu Yudeng County Gate. A mother said that the woman: &quot;The book is suitable for the government, and tomorrow will come to marry. Why not make clothes? Do not give up!&quot; A woman silent, hand towel to cover the mouth, tears will be like a diarrhea. Move my glazed couch out of the front window. Hold the knife ruler on the left and hold the armor on the right hand. Chaocheng embroidered skirt, late into a single sweater. Dark (y\u01ceny\u01cen) wants to swear, and thinks about it. The government has heard this change, and it has temporarily returned due to seeking a holiday. Not until two or three miles, destroying (z\u00e0ng) horses sad. The new woman knows the sound of the horse, and she meets with each other. Looking at each other, I know that it is the old man. Raise your hand to slap the saddle and sigh to make your heart hurt: &quot;After you don&#39;t care for me, people can&#39;t be measured. It&#39;s not as good as the first wish, not the details. I have parents, persecution and brothers. The house is said to be a bride: &quot;He Qing has to move high! The stone is thick and thick, and it can be a thousand years. When Pu Pu is a singer, it will be a eve. Qing will win the day, and I will go to Huang Quan alone!&quot; The new woman said: &quot; What is the meaning of this! The same is forced, Juner is also the same. Huang Quan met, do not violate today&#39;s words!&quot; Handle to go, each home. Let&#39;s be dead, hate that can be said? Read the world and resign, never return! The house is still home, and worships the mother: &quot;The wind is cold today, the wind blows the trees, and the frost is knotted.&quot; Children are in the dark today, so that the mother is in the post. Therefore, as a bad plan, do not resent the ghosts and gods! Life is like Nanshan Stone, four body Kang and straight!&quot; A mother heard it, tears should fall: &quot;Hey, everyone, Shi Yi in the Taiwan Pavilion. Be careful not to die for a woman, how noble is the love! The Dong family has a wise woman, Yan Yancheng Guo, and the mother is a pleading, it will be in the evening.&quot; The palace revisited, sighed in the room, made a count Standing. Turned to the household, and gradually became simmered. On the day of the day, the bride and wife entered the Qing Dynasty. After the dusk, the silent people will be at the beginning. &quot;I am destined for today, the soul goes to the corpse to stay!&quot; The skirt skirted off, and went to Qingchi. The government heard about the incident and knew that it was long. Under the tree in the court, the southeast branch is self-hanging. The two asked for burial and buried the Huashan Mountain. Things are planted with pines and cypresses. The branches are covered and the leaves are in traffic. There are two flying birds in the middle. Looking up at each other, the night reaches five. The pedestrian stopped to listen, and the widow groaned.

"title_en": "Hahaha", "content_en": "Actually, I have to comment, can I register? Alexander, I don\u2019t know if I haven\u2019t used it, so I hope to finish writing and register. Then I can\u2019t use it. I haven\u2019t used it. The world needs to use camera to take everything. The beautiful things that are not good are recorded and recorded. The truth is already slightly morbid. But this is the way for human beings to join in the fun of nature. What is the solution? Oh, the days are so warm, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s fortunate. Still alert, not doing anything that is too great, but not doing nothing at all, but still not satisfied with myself, but can not completely negate. Memory is forgotten for details and activities because of the dullness. Short-lived surprises and happiness are always gone. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing, my mind is like the depleted spring is gradually being squeezed out / the night&#39;s lightning is particularly beautiful, without the umbrella, the wind is blowing, and there is a devastating trend. If this is an endless plain, then I don\u2019t know when the rain will come. It will make people have the panic of grass and trees. All of a sudden in July, I passed by half in July. Hey, I said, I have already discovered my weakness, my feelings, my conscience, and my unconscious suspicion of others. Powerless disdain. Lack of goodwill in mind, not too much heat and ambition to live. Everything is persuaded to find a way to solve literature and art, so what do I ask, compared with the past, decisive and so careful, so narrow, is it because of the people I met, but why can\u2019t I insist on my original intention? It\u2019s not ridiculous, it\u2019s ridiculous, it\u2019s too transparent to be heard by others, but if you want to go it alone, how do you go to the pollen of the black tableware? In summary, I am too busy. I\u2019m too stupid and weak, I can\u2019t always find a balance between the two. Anyway, I can\u2019t find a way to lose myself in this contradiction. The person who can\u2019t be fooled is yourself. Really, always self-defeating, I am not a box of that lovely person, intermittent mourning, but still have to work hard to do things well. If you can help others, you can only help yourself and you can only comfort yourself. Ability, right, why haven\u2019t you finished it yet? I really can\u2019t feel it anymore. Why\u2019s it\u2019s not finished yet. Isn\u2019t this, has it become a moral kidnapping? It\u2019s too much. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very good right now. After all, it&#39;s already in the middle of the night. I&#39;m here to take a break and weird things seem to be particularly confusing. Today&#39;s green apple is especially delicious. I have eaten two. The pumpkin is especially delicious. It is not cooked for too long, so it is still hard. So I have to cook it a few years ago. I want to draw a few butterflies today. I feel watercolor. Very fun. I think, the upper limit of this word is definitely made out of psychology, sociology, big data, and it is used to avoid the minimum limit of people who have nothing to say and talk about nonsense. Between the uncles, otherwise it is too low to reach the area, too high is difficult to reach, and all of a sudden will make people give up. I don&#39;t know when it will be the next heavy rain, the kind of heavy rain, the heavy rain, and the kind of rain that makes people feel calm and return to the summer. I am a bit incoherent and impatient, but I have to insist on it. Because I can store people, if I develop this app in the future, I can&#39;t forgive myself. Really, maybe. What to eat for lunch tomorrow, green vegetables, there should be, Chinese cabbage, Dong Hao, chrysanthemum dishes, melons to refine pumpkin. I like to eat tomatoes, eat tomato scrambled eggs, and ask for advice.", "id": "2973068304", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "5", "version": "55.0", "author": "sunflowerbiubiubiu", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Instagram"}

Poor drain: The drain is sluggish due to slack or bending into a wavy shape. 3. Dew condensation on the piping: Since the insulation material on the piping is too poor or too thin, condensation will be caused when the refrigerant in the tube passes. 4. Heat exchanger dripping: 1) The temperature of the heat exchanger is not uniform due to the heat exchanger being contaminated with dust, and water droplets are generated in the middle of the heat exchanger, and water droplets falling outside the water tray will drip into the room. 2) Insufficient refrigerant in the air conditioning system causes the indoor unit to freeze, and the water droplets formed by the ice melting do not directly drop into the water receiving tray. When there is a leak in the indoor unit, you can perform self-test according to the above conditions. You can do two things: 1. Check if the machine is tilted in the air conditioner; 2. If the drain pipe is cracked (hand tapping from different angles by hand) Tube, see if there are cracks).

This mythological dream of Waller&#39;s fiction is a typical representative of a considerable part of American value psychology, just as Richard is as ridiculous as his pen. The Frankish school is extremely accurate in summarizing this kind of social psychology: in an industrialized society, the manifestation of the individual being devastated is that the desire is not satisfied. It is because of the destruction of the society by people that there is a utopian impulse and utopian A fantasy change to the whole world. This is what Freud said, &quot;Dream is the achievement of aspiration.&quot; Literary creation is essentially a manifestation of the &quot;daydream&quot; of the subconscious mind that the writer is suppressed by the norms of civil society. It can be said that a &quot;dream of the bridge&quot; is sold at almost the same time in the East and West, not only revealing the general mentality of the American people and the invisible inner secrets, but also reflecting the lurking anxiety of many Chinese readers. .

All the men in Greece want to get her heart, but they are destined to return. Because the girl&#39;s body and mind have long been dedicated to the pure goddess Athena, as the goddess of the priest, she made a vow, never marry, keep the chastity, and wholeheartedly serve the goddess. She should have lived a life that was respected by thousands of people, but she was unfortunately tricked by fate. The beauty of the girl is coveted with the gods. On a rainy night, Poseidon was driven by desire and tarnished the girl in the temple. She was &quot;no longer pure&quot;, she was driven out of the temple, and the people who respected her in the past turned to spurn her, and Athena was furious. The goddess is not angry because the sea god has raped the girl, but she is angry because the &quot;impurity&quot; girl is still alive. The girl was cursed by the goddess, her soft long hair twisted into a snake, and her bright eyes gradually lost her look. Since then, there has been a girl in the world who has been favored by the gods, and a horrible snake-haired banshee, Medusa. Everyone who has seen her eyes will turn into a stone. Everyone is afraid of her. Everyone is far away from her. She is getting farther and farther away from the world. Maybe Medusa&#39;s heart is still a kind girl, but no one cares. In the eyes of the world, she is just a dirty woman. She is just a terrible banshee. The Dragon Warrior will also care about the idea of \u200b\u200bthe dragon. The &quot;Scarred Warriors&quot; went on and on, but they turned into stone statues one by one. Medusa&#39;s notoriety gradually grew, until the son of Zeus took down her head with the weapon of God. She died alone, and she still bears the notoriety of the sky after her death. She is the most tragic monster I know. She has done nothing wrong. The only thing that is wrong is that she is born in this evil person. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The attitude of the ancient Greeks towards life is the present, and it is a hedonistic spirit that pays attention to physical enjoyment. But as a priest, it seems that he was deprived of all this by nature, and Medusa silently endured it all. But even then, fate made a joke with her. According to the custom of the time, the priestess had to keep chaste in their lives, but Medusa had a beautiful face. Perhaps beauty is a kind of original sin, and the tragedy begins. Poseidon, the god of the sea, coveted her beauty and raped her. She once ran to the temple of Athena to pray for asylum, but she was taken away in the temple. Afterwards, Athena was very angry that she was not chaste, and she made a curse. Any man who saw her face would be petrified. Finally, the lonely Medusa escaped to the end of the underworld. The endings of Medusa&#39;s various versions are roughly the same, she was killed by Perseus. In fact, Medusa is a tragedy of mortals. (Greek mythology only states that Medusa and Poseidon are sleepy. In Roman mythology, Medusa was raped by Poseidon.) In Greek and Roman mythology, Both Poseidon and Athena are representatives of the patriarchal society (Athena) Although they are goddesses, they maintain male rights everywhere, and they adopt an indifferent attitude towards women&#39;s rights. For Poseidon, Medusa is only a tool for venting desire. For Athena, Medusa is only a tool to maintain faith. Once she is no longer &quot;pure,&quot; she has no value. When Athena was angry, she turned the beautiful Medusa into a dead body with a poisonous snake on her head. The transformation of Medusa has aroused the curiosity of men and has also aroused their courage. Men are vying to kill Medusa. Medusa was unfortunate. Zeus\u2019s illegitimate son Perseus eventually killed her with the help of the gods. Medusa is isolated and helpless. Even on a desert island, it is impossible to escape the fate of tragedy. Athena gave her a pair of holes to wear everything in the world, others look at the eyes of fossils, but this is not a gift to her, but a ruthless punishment and verdict on her. Medusa was completely isolated. For such a person who is not human, ghost or ghost, Medusa, death may be the best relief. The image of Medusa in mythology is fixed. It is an objective reflection of the status of women in that era. Besides mythology, we have to make her name through her own interpretation. If thousands of years later, there are still &quot;rapists.&quot; It is not a great irony that this kind of argument is guilty.

"title_en": "I heard that I have to comment first to register successfully.", "content_en": "Everyone knows that the drama &quot;Journey to the West&quot; after the theme of &quot;Journey to the West&quot; is known. The setting of the big villain in the drama is that the mana is equivalent to the Buddha of the Buddha. According to the saying before the Buddha in the drama: &quot; This stranger and other mana can be lowered.&quot; Later, the big devil took the sky to take over Lingshan. If the Buddha said that he had a revelation, he ran away. Then Tang Yin, the reincarnation of the second disciple, Jin Yuzi, realized this episode in the Nine Nether, saying that only Sun Wukong can save the Three Realms. Is there really only Sun Wukong to deal with? Looking at the original &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, you will find that even if there is no law and the Buddha is as boundless as the Buddha, even the Jade Emperor is under house arrest, but at least these seven great gods, no one can not afford it. 01. Taiqing morality is respected by Laojun, and in the &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, there is no ancestors in the Laojun, but the original Taoist ancestors in the &quot;Journey to the West&quot; are everywhere, and they do not mention the Taoist ancestors. The magic weapon, his horse riding a green cattle is enough to drink a pot. When Sun Wukong went to Lingshan to inquire about the details of the green cattle, if the Buddha did not dare to say it, he could only hint at Sun Wukong, and he was afraid that the green cow would go to Lingshan to make trouble. If you add the King of Golden Horn and the King of Silver Point, you will also occupy the Three Realms and return to the darkness. 02. The Bodhisattva of the Shouyue Sanxing Dongling Lingfang Square Mountain in the &quot;Xiyou Jihou Biography&quot; Sun Wukong became the monkey of the heavenly election to save the Three Realms. I would like to ask the Bodhi who taught Sun Wukong &quot;the seventy-two changes of the mantle&quot; and &quot;the muscles of the clouds&quot; The ancestor, is it possible to kill the sky? Moreover, in the original &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, Sun Wukong learned art in Fangzhongshan for ten years. The Bodhi ancestor began to teach him seriously. In three years, it is known that there are many cows in the Bodhi ancestor. If you combine the identity of the Bodhi ancestor of the &quot;Feng Shen Yan&quot;, The Western teachings of the second sect of the sect of the sect of the singer, no one has no sings, and the sage is bound to take the seven treasures of the second tree who can be enemies! 03. Wanshoushan Wuzhuangguan Town Yuan Daxian in the &quot;Journey to the West&quot; in the town of Yuanxian is depicted as a fairy with the Sun Wukong peers, the mana is not so good, at least the heavenly god of the black lotus can be trapped he. I have seen the original &quot;Journey to the West&quot; know that there are many cattle in the town of Da Yuan, he mixed with the &quot;community with the world&quot; and do not worship Sanqing, only worship the heavens and the earth, the word of the world, but also he compiled. It also has a spiritual root &quot;grass returning Dan&quot; which was born when Chaos was first opened. It is also called ginseng fruit. It has no strength against the heavens. The Bodhi ancestors who came to live in the west of Hezhou, and the Buddha of the Buddha, have long been robbed. Since Zhenyuan Daxian is not afraid of coming to the Buddha, why not fear the big devil. 04. Yu Qingyuan Shi Tianzun in the &quot;Journey to the West&quot; is not too old Laojun, not to mention the first of the Qing Dynasty, the Yuqing Yuan Shi Tianzun, in the Taoist Yuan Yuan Tian Zun is the first god in the gods. In the original &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, Zhenyuan Daxian called it &quot;Da Tianzun&quot;. An invitation will have to go to the Heavenly Palace in the upper Qing Dynasty to listen to the mixed fruit. Everyone knows that Taoism is a day when Laojun is open to the elders. You know that Yuanshi Tianzun existed before the birth of the universe, and therefore respected it as the beginning of the Yuan. You can refer to &quot;Tai Shang Laojun Kai Tian Jing&quot; and &quot;The Past Heavens&quot; . 05. Shangqing Lingbao Tianzun did not have Taoist &quot;Sanqing&quot; in &quot;The Journey to the West&quot;, but in the original &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, the Taoist &quot;Sanqing&quot; existed. In fact, in the Taoism, &quot;Sanqing&quot; is one. The so-called Daoshengyi, the second generation, the second birth, the third life, the three births, this two-three finger is that when Hongmeng is not cut, there is no aura of agility to form a group of Yuanguang, the beginning of the infinite master of the Promise. Tianzun; the second Huayu Road, Jun Ling Bao Tianzun; the third, the Taiqing Holy Lord morality. No one can even deal with moral ethics, not to mention the first two of &quot;Sanqing&quot;. 06. Donghua Shandong Huadijun occupied the Three Realms in &quot;The Journey to the West&quot;, and did not occupy the Donghua Mountain of the Emperor of Donghua. Sun Wukong also placed the reincarnation of the Buddha, Joe Linger, in the Donghua Mountain. Please ask Donghua Emperor for care. In the Taoist culture, the Emperor of the Middle East is the East Wanggong, responsible for management is all male fairy. In the Eastern Jin Dynasty&#39;s &quot;Pillow Book&quot;, he also has an identity. The son of Yuanshi Tianzun is the Fuwang Emperor Dongwanggong, and the number is Yuanyang Yang. In Taoism, his position is under the Sanqing, above the four royalties. What&#39;s more, he is also the Donghua Zifu Shaoyang Emperor in the Song and Yuan Dynasties. 07. The Queen of the Queen of the Queen of the Kunlun Mountains, Yaochi, does not seem to have the Western Queen in the &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, but in the original &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, the Western Queen Mother is an important role. Without her feast of Yaochi, Peach and Peach, how does Sun Wukong make a big noise? Many people in the TV series think that the Jade Emperor and the West Queen are husband and wife. In fact, everyone is wrong. The East Wang and the West Queen are husbands and wives. The West Queen is the head of the female fairy. The two husbands are in charge of the three men and women, and they do not mention her mana. Kunlun Mountain, where she lives, is also called Kunlun Virtual. This mountain of Wanzu, the heavenly occupation of the Three Realms is a joke. Telling the truth, &quot;Journey to the West&quot; is not only the ghost-like martial arts movement, but also the Buddha&#39;s reincarnation to fall in love, the heavenly name is called Sun Wukong as Wukong, Tang Yan will also martial arts, the most ridiculous is the heavenly occupation of the Three Realms. Which of the seven great gods above is innocent? Can&#39;t afford to talk about the occupation of the Three Realms?
