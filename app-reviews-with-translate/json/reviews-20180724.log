But what happened today with me for the first time in a taxi in general, has deceived me (and not only me). At 11:33 (I can be mistaken in minutes, you can see in the canceled trip) to me the taxi has COME. At me, on hands there was a small dog of breed micro-\u0447\u0438\u0445\u0443\u0430. I&#39;m not expecting anything bad by greeting the driver as usual, sitting down with the dog in my hands in the back seat. In a split second I hear the perfect mate in my address! I jump out of the car in shock. It turns out that I had to call him and warn him that I have a pet in my hands. When I went to the car, sit down and when I greeted the driver, it is possible for me to say my attitude to animals and my point of view! HUMANLY!! Leaving from the car to the entrance, I and people sitting on the bench heard the continuation of the mat! Then I canceled the trip. Seeing this in his phone, the &quot;driver&quot; jumped out of the car, ran up to me and started waving his hands in front of my face, selling me talking in his apparently native language-mate. Demanding to tell him that I wrote in the comments after the cancellation! I was in such a stress that I did not even think about the comments at the time. Hearing the cries from the street, my dad had to go down quickly. The driver closed in the car, provoking my father with mate and insults! Then he left. I am sure that such &quot;drivers&quot; should not appear on the roads of our country. As a result, my whole family received a lot of stress and I was late for the meeting! (there are enough witnesses). Please take action!

Honesty is the foundation of the Confucian moral system, sincerity, the way of heaven; Honesty, it is true and innocent, it is the foundation of morality, it is the common path of human beings. It is the promise of trustworthiness, the fact that no one believes or not, the industry has no faith, and the country is untrustworthy.

Shameless, talk about self-respect and self-improvement. &quot;Dedication and dedication&quot; reflects &quot;loyalty&quot; and &quot;righteousness&quot;. The essence of &quot;loyalty&quot; is &quot;Responsibility&quot;, due diligence, and loyalty to duty. &quot;Responsibility&quot; is the &quot;dedication&quot; soul. &quot;Yi&quot; is the pursuit, the integrity, the benefit He, dedication is &quot;a matter of righteousness and lightness&quot;, &quot;seeing the righteousness and braveness&quot;, &quot;killing the body and becoming a benevolent person, giving birth to justice.&quot; If the above explanation can be established, then the &quot;20 words&quot; civic ethics will at least include loyalty, filial piety, honesty, Letters, courtesy, righteousness, honesty, shame, diligence, envy, lenient, forgiveness, etc., 12 basic &quot;German eyes&quot; in China and Germany. Therefore, the &quot;20 words&quot; citizen moral code promulgated by the state in 2001 is Chinese. It took more than 50 years to pay a huge historical cost, experienced a process of repeated exploration, and finally formed a new system of &quot;civil moral norms&quot; that basically conforms to the requirements of the times. Modern transformation of China and Germany and the ideological and moral education of minors The generation and development of morality cannot be separated from the blood of national culture, and it cannot cut off the history of the moral culture of the nation. History has proved that the attempt to completely negate history, start a new stove, and construct a &quot;new moral system&quot; is only a big deal. I can use my own hands to carry my own hair and leave the land. History also proves that moral construction as a national value cannot rely on &quot;importation&quot;. Otherwise, the original moral culture of the nation is &quot;discarded&quot;, and the introduced morality cannot be rooted in the fertile soil of Chinese culture for a long time, and it cannot be China. People agree, so the &quot;old&quot; is thrown away, and the new one cannot be established, resulting in a long-term &quot;break&quot; and &quot;blank&quot; of moral culture. Moral construction is a historical process that requires the unremitting struggle of one or two generations. It is by no means pragmatic, quick success, and immediate success. In the past ten years, Beijing Philosophical and Social Science and National Education Science Planning have continuously carried out key research projects, &quot;Experimental Research on Chinese Traditional Virtue Education in Large, Middle and Primary Schools&quot;. The eight core virtues are: loyalty, filial piety, honesty, faith, courtesy, and righteousness. It is incorruptible and shameful. It is intended to inherit the traditional virtues of China and to give new era connotations and reflect the new value of national vitality. In the practice of the &quot;Chinese-German-German&quot; educational experiment in the past ten years, through the determination of the system of morality and the preparation of teaching materials, we gradually discovered eight ethics of &quot;loyalty, filial piety, honesty, faith, rites, righteousness, honesty, shame&quot;, which is the construction of today&#39;s schools. The important basis of the German system is that this &quot;eight virtues&quot; is not only the traditional Chinese virtues that have been handed down, renewed and developed by the Chinese nation for generations since 5,000 years; it is also the &quot;student code&quot; in today&#39;s social life and in primary, middle and primary schools. Among them, in the civic conventions, in the professional ethics of all walks of life, in the way of governing the family, the way of the industry, and the way of governing the country, the national spirit is soaked. In order to construct the moral system of the traditional virtues of the school, and to help teachers and educators who participate in educational experiments, understand the historical evolution of &quot;Bude&quot;; grasp and distinguish the duality of the essence and dross of &quot;Bade&quot;; The historical value; explore the response of &quot;Bude&quot; to the moral problems of modern society; master the path of improving their moral cultivation. The research team spent a year in 1999, organized eight doctors of liberal arts to write, and by the Red Flag Publishing House in early 2000, published the &quot;Popular Morals&quot; series, each of which was written by one of the doctors. These eight books are: &quot;Loyalty - Doing the Responsibility of Serving the Country&quot; &quot;Xiao------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - The guide of the right path of the human world &quot;Lian - the foundation of innocence&quot; &quot;Shame - the bottom line of human beings&quot; According to the different functions of each virtue, this eight virtues can be roughly divided into four levels: First, &quot; Righteousness and &quot;loyalty&quot; and &quot;righteousness&quot;--the guidance of the right path of human beings is the moral soul, the moral spiritual realm and the value orientation; &quot;loyalty&quot;--the responsibility of serving the country, the core of morality, the moral consciousness and the value goal Second, &quot;honest&quot; and &quot;faith&quot; &quot;honest&quot; - the quality of seeking truth and being pragmatic, is the moral quality, the moral personality requirement and the economic value; &quot;the letter&quot; - the basic point of establishing the industry, is the moral quality, is the moral Personality requirements and economic value; third, &quot;And &quot;Lian&quot; &quot;Rite&quot; - the norm of interpersonal civilization is moral quality, moral external manifestation and civilized value; &quot;Lian&quot; - the foundation of innocence, moral conscience, moral external performance and political value Fourth, &quot;filial piety&quot; and &quot;shame&quot; &quot;filial piety&quot; - endless love is morality, moral and emotional foundation and value source; &quot;shame&quot; - the bottom line of human beings, is moral psychology, It is the basis of moral psychology and the choice of value. This &quot;eight virtues&quot;, from the social, economic, political and other fields, covers the moral relationship between individuals and families and society. A Chinese person can have this to varying degrees. Eight kinds of morality, that is, a person with morality, will not only lag behind the times, but will also become the stronghouse of the new century. The entire country, by establishing such a system of moral standards, can gradually build a &quot;state of etiquette&quot; in the new century. To do this, you must be a good social citizen.", "id": "2964478149", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "5", "version": "181.0", "author": "Y\u5c0f\u5c0f\u6653", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Facebook"}

the people? The sunset glows the dead leaves, the autumn geese are accompanied by Xiafei, the arcs of the dead leaves are drawn, one piece, two pieces, and the pieces flew off. You see, the elf-like leaf is a little obsessed with the shallow otter, a little bit of greed for the only green child, or a light fascination with your just-initiated Tiptoe. Everything seems so natural, so peaceful, so coordinated. Perhaps, no one has ever cared about where this greenery came from, and how to leave quietly. What I saw, maybe it was just the geese flying in the deciduous light in the south. The autumn wind sweeps the leaves, the autumn rain drops on the window, the leaves are flying, and the geese fly south. The wild goose flies south, flying over Qianshan and Wanshui. Where is the love that is waiting for the intoxication of the millennium, where is the permanent port of berthing? How many roads, how many bridges, how many bridges to cross the passionate people How many rivers have you crossed, only to find the foothold of your soul, the leaves of the soul are rooted. Or perhaps, when we discuss this issue, we will always silently faint this book to show me a story of a kind, simple, honest rickshaw Xiangzi in a dark society. Xiangzi&#39;s ideal is to have a car of his own. He saves his life every day and gets up early. After three years of hard work, he finally bought a car, but he was quickly taken away by the soldiers. Later, he finally got enough. After buying the car money, he was sent to the blackmail by Sun Detective. Later, his wife Hu Niu bought the car with his savings, but the tiger girl was difficult to die. In order to bury her, Xiangzi sold the car again, twists and turns, in the end. But nothing. Xiangzi\u2019s life was full of hardships. He finally became a loser. In the cruel and realistic society, the dying of the lover he experienced hard and hard, became stunned and self-satisfied. The society is always ruthless. If one cannot keep on going, it will become a stepping stone for others, and you will be scratched and bruised. Of course, the root cause of the tragedy of Xiangzi\u2019s life is the dark society and the ruthless people. My favorite Xiangzi is hardworking, kind and honest, and very motivated. He constantly struggles. Even if the tiger girl dies, he sells the car and buryes the tiger girl. He still does not give up. What he wants is It is a normal life and a peaceful life. Xiangzi is a laborer at the bottom of the society. He has the personality characteristics that others do not have. In order to live and persevere in pursuing his ideals, he still cannot escape the bondage of fate, and ultimately is a tragedy. Just like the Gusla brothers, they are also the bottom workers in society. They are persistently making the best boots. They have excellent qualities, but because of social injustice, their lives are also tragedies. We should feel happy, our society is a beautiful society, our life is very happy, we have Xiangzi never experienced freedom and happiness, but we can&#39;t be immersed in happiness. As teenagers, we are carrying parents and teachers. The expectations, we also have the dreams we pursue, we also need to work hard, like Xiangzi, bravely and firmly achieve their goals, but I believe that our ending is not degenerate, it will be like an eagle flying wings, Flying freely in the air. &quot;Camel Xiangzi&quot; tells us to cherish life, cherish every moment, we must work hard to study hard, and lay a smooth road for our future. Xiangzi\u2019s ideal is to buy a car. Even if it has been defeated repeatedly, it must be persisted again and again. I believe that I will fight for my own efforts. All the roads lead to Rome.

[2] Xiangzi came from the countryside and was a bankrupt young farmer. He was hardworking, simple, and kind. He kept everything in the countryside to nurture him and raise him, but he was no longer willing to go back to the countryside. Xiangzi, who came to the city from the countryside, is eager to buy a car of his own with his honest work. To be an independent laborer is Xiangzi&#39;s volunteerism, hope, and even religion. With diligence and perseverance, he spent three years saving and using it. He finally realized his ideal and became a self-sufficient top driver. However, just after half a year, the car was taken away by the deserters in the chaos of the soldiers. Xiangzi lost the car and only took back three camels. Xiangzi is not discouraged, he still reluctantly starts from the beginning, more self-denying to pull the car to save money. However, he has not waited for him to buy another car. All his savings have been blackmailed and looted by detectives. The dream of buying a car has once again become a bubble. When Xiangzi once again pulled his own car, it was at the expense of the abnormal marriage of Hu Niu. The good times are not long, because Hu Niu died of dystocia, he had to sell rickshaws to eat funeral. At this point, his life ideals were completely shattered. Coupled with the suicide of his beloved woman, Xiao Fuzi, the last spark of hope in the heart was blown out. After being hit by life, Xiangzi began to lose any desire and confidence in life, and could no longer courage in life. He was no longer proud of pulling a car as before. He hated pulling cars and hating labor. Xiangzi, who was teased by life, started to play games, eat and drink gambling.

Xiangzi, who came to the city from the countryside, is eager to buy a car of his own with his honest work. To be an independent laborer is Xiangzi&#39;s volunteerism, hope, and even religion. With diligence and perseverance, he spent three years saving and using it. He finally realized his ideal and became a self-sufficient top driver. However, just after half a year, the car was taken away by the deserters in the chaos of the soldiers. Xiangzi lost the car and only took back three camels. Xiangzi is not discouraged, he still reluctantly starts from the beginning, more self-denying to pull the car to save money. However, he has not waited for him to buy another car. All his savings have been blackmailed and looted by detectives. The dream of buying a car has once again become a bubble.

On March 5, 2014, Google said that users in 22 cities in India have access to 75 local maps of popular indoor venues in Google Maps, including Ambience Mall in Gurgaon and Select City Walk in Delhi. . In March 2018, Google Maps added features about disabled people. Google collects user data to match the places and routes that the disabled are going to, and displays on the map a wheelchair-friendly public transportation route to Google Maps. Services in the UK, Canada, Japan, and other regions are already in the completion stage. In some parts of North America, the Street View service was launched. Users can view street views from a street perspective (such as bus stops, shops, etc.). However, the service is suspected of infringing on personal privacy, because the photos of Street View are randomly photographed on the street by Google&#39;s beetle car. The action of the street passers-by and the license plate number at the parking point are clear. Google Maps&#39; China service is still in beta testing. The Hong Kong version was launched in July 2008. You can let users search for restaurants, or create their own maps to share photos and comments with other users. Other features include route queries that show the distance between two locations and travel time.", "id": "2961029377", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "5", "version": "4.54", "author": "\u6668\u548c123589", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "GoogleMaps"}
