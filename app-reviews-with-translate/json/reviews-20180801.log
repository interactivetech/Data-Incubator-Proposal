But recently Netflix is really going downhill, you\u2019re going downhill Netflix. Let\u2019s start with the criticism, anime for one. I love anime and as an anime nerd I love it when I can watch a lot of anime, Netflix on the other hand has an estimate of 20 and anime\u2019s and a half of those are like Pok\u00e9mon movies and shows. I am going to start comparing now because I have to make a point. Here, if you look at Hulu, which I\u2019m also subscribe to, they have the hugest selection of anime and they have full//all seasons and all the episodes. For example, Naruto, Hulu has four seasons which is all the seasons of Naruto and all the episodes now if you look at Netflix Netflix only has three seasons and not even all of the episodes of the third season. And Hulu has all the seasons of fairytale, black butler, attack on Titan, etc. Now for the second thing the movies and the shows. I used to love those shows and movies they had on Netflix. But now. Netflix I can\u2019t even right now with how much I hate the movies and shows you have. I can go through everything and cant find barely any good movies or shows. I mean there are some here in there like pretty little liars, the Fosters, switched at birth, etc. but movie wise and just basic show wise nothing is good, maybe five shows and a few movies here and there but otherwise it\u2019s garbage. I\u2019m sorry just being completely honest with this. I hope that you learn from this criticism Netflix because this is really making me annoyed. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this but I actually like hulu better I mean if you went add free it\u2019s basically 10 times better than you. Just being honest. On the third and last final thing. The way you rate things. Oh my God Netflix I could go on and on and on and on about the way rate things. Let\u2019s start a show I used to watch called men on a mission. Now the show is basically a reality show there\u2019s men obviously and they\u2019re in a classroom like a skit skit classroom and they make jokes and make skits and invite k-pop stars to join. And what they do is they play mini games with these K-pop stars there just fun little mini games. Now this show used to be rated TV 14, No Netflix has changed it to TV-MA and yet men on a mission does the same thing they did before. There\u2019s no sex in it they have cussing here in there you know like the SH word and maybe inappropriate jokes here and there but nothing worth getting rated TV-MA. If shows had inappropriate jokes and some cussing here in there and get rated TV-MA then all the shows that are rated TV 14 right now should be TV-MA if that\u2019s the code. Do you notice how stupid that sounds right now. Very stupid. Netflix. OK well I am done with my criticism, Netflix I hope that you read this and I hope that you take this into consideration and fix everything because seriously you\u2019re going downhill. Very. Down. Hill. And if you don\u2019t fix this or fix what everyone is trying to say to you. You are going to hit rock bottom and there might not be anyway to save the sinking ship. Sorry for the brutal honesty and criticism that I gave but I hope this changes you for the better.\nAdi\u00f3s.", "title_en": "Netflix is going downhill....", "content_en": "Dear Netflix,\n I have loved Netflix for a very very long time.

I went to see you this evening and I like this style very much. It doesn&#39;t make sense. We don&#39;t pick up urgent calls online, but we fall asleep at the center of life and music! What do you say? I don\u2019t want to see anything here... Let\u2019s see if there is any time for a holiday... We can understand and help us know when we are going to have a holiday! You are coming to our company...what are we going outside to come to such a person... I want to go home to eat? We don&#39;t dare to say that you don&#39;t like it yourself... It&#39;s about the unique style of the music, the unique and fashionable element, the crystal constellation bracelet, what&#39;s the matter... We know it ourselves... It&#39;s also beautiful...

We know for ourselves that we like to eat something to understand that you will not change anything in your current life as long as you look for a job in the past! There are also many feelings about this situation? I have a lot of fun chatting together... We can see a lot of things, we will all support you to cheer up... Whatever happens, what can\u2019t be said, if you don\u2019t want us to do it later... or you should study hard every day. It\u2019s also a light lifestyle change, when is our lifestyle coming back... It\u2019s also a matter of caring for them, and it\u2019s not that others care about others... This kind of person doesn\u2019t need anyone to attend your funeral. Can life habits be fine? It\u2019s uncomfortable to eat outside!

"title_en": "registered", "content_en": "Why is it a comment or not? I am a piece of paper, this is a rainy night, I am lying in the trash can on the corner. The barrel is not covered, the night wind is chilling for a lot of time, I will still have a holiday set of more than a dozen miracles sister: cocktails will be home to plan today, etc. Where are you going to go, where are you going to crash? Where is the skin good collector? I put the bus Familiarity does not express one will forget to gather, I feel that the total amount of marrying chicken with the chicken is called Sagha&#39;s big collection. Forget the mobile phone brother-in-law to eat the chicken miracle. Waikiki wants and brings the taste of the earth. Although it is a bit cold, I am still very comfortable; I have a dilapidated eave on my head, blocking the night rain for me and my junk friends. I quietly watched the sky in the night, silently listening to the sound of fallen leaves in the wind. A raindrop fell on my head and went down my face. I wanted to stretch my hands and feet and wipe the rain, but I found myself I have already been smashed into a ball, and I laughed at myself, letting the rain flow in my straight and straight body. I am old, although I have only been in the world for only a few days. I remember when I was a child, my brother and sister were a tree. We lived in the forest. The top of the head was a blue sky. At the foot was a fertile soil. At first glance, it was boundless green grass. One breath was full of fragrance. There are always birds singing around, and the sound of the creek is often heard in the ears. We are firmly rooted and grow freely. Our greatest ideal is to grow into a towering tree, and the tree boss around us is our idol. We try our best to look up, but we can&#39;t see his face, only see his body in the golden sun. . We believe that the meaning of life lies in the continuous growth. One day, the lumberjack came, the tree boss fell, the sky above us became more open, and the wind around us was blowing more urgently. We cried for the tree boss, he was lying in the grass, and he bowed his head in the past. Weeds that are invisible at the waist are now covered with his face. &quot;Don&#39;t be sad, as a tree, a big tree, there will be such a day. In fact, this is just an alternation of life forms. As a tree, my life is over. The root of my life is the memory of this life.&quot; And mark. And tomorrow, I will be made into various items and shipped to the rest of the world, I will continue my life journey in another way. Remember, the impermanence of life lies in the unpredictable future, this is one The challenge is a tribulation. As a big tree, this is also a kind of happiness. I am proud of the life of my tree, and I will be proud of my more life. I will stand up! Facing fate The wind and rain, cherish this life, and meet the next challenge.&quot; The tree boss left, and gradually we became a big tree. When we blocked the sun and the wind and rain, we knew that the new fate was waving to us. Soon, we were transported to the factory, we were cut, pressed, melted, shaped, and when the sun shone again, I found myself a blank piece of paper, and my brothers and sisters, like me, stood up straight, Quietly waiting for the fate of the noisy machine. The beautiful brothers and sisters are transported away, their prospects are beautiful, they will be written with beautiful words, put on a unique coat, become a famous masterpiece of people&#39;s collection, or a best-selling book that everyone buys; they will be Painting beautiful patterns, handwriting of celebrities, and decorating the room. People are more fortunate that they will wear a colorful vest with lines, avatars and figures to become a cute person. Tickets, the size of the numbers on their vests determines how popular they are. Their destiny is long-lasting and bright. There are not many beautiful brothers and sisters, just like unbeautiful brothers and sisters. Unbeautiful brothers and sisters will be crushed into food boxes, paper cups, greasy chicken legs, hot potato chips, thick juices or frothy beer. After people have a meal, they are accompanied by wreckage. Their life as paper will soon end. They will also be made into boxes and gift boxes. Although they know that people don&#39;t need them, they still try to make this life look brilliant. The most unfortunate brothers were made into toilet paper, using their ugly and white body to wipe out the smudges of people. The reward they received was cast aside and thrown into the sewer. The fate of impermanence, the creation of people, the same roots, the gap is so great. Of course, most of my brothers and sisters, like me, are a blank piece of paper. We stick together and feel the power of each other, just like we used to be a tree. In the face of the future, we have some tensions, some embarrassment, and some fears, but we know that no matter what fate, we can&#39;t escape. This time, we want to make it live as wonderful as the life of a big tree. I was transported to the people&#39;s desk with the paper brothers, and our new job is responsible for the records. The brothers were taken out one by one, written in various forms, painted on a table, painted in red and blue ink, and then left forever, some were taken away, some were torn, and some were abandoned. I looked at it silently, there was a hint of embarrassment, this time the life was so short, although it is still great. I am eager to embark on this path of life, I am eager to reincarnate in the life of Nirvana, but I still cry for this fleeting milestone. With the departure of the brothers, the coolness of my body is deep. As the imprint of the tree gradually disappears, our life is like a piece of paper. It is more frivolous but more wide-ranging, weaker but taller and smaller. But it is more free. Finally, I was selected, I smiled at the brothers, waved my hand and set foot on my destiny. I squatted straight on the table, the sharp nib and the dark ink flying on my back, I bit my teeth, endure the torture, no sound, no motion, I know, no heartbreaking Pain, there is no value of life, and at the moment of my glory, a new destiny will come. The pain on my back seems to have no end. With a lot of pain, my consciousness is gradually gone and gradually blurred. I seem to have returned to the past. I have become a small tree. In the mountains, by the stream, I am And the brothers and sisters sucked the nectar, stretched the branches, we swayed in the breeze, we were higher than the grass, we played with the bugs, the longer we grew, the longer we grew, the longer we grew... When I woke up, the night was deep. I was tired in a trash can, surrounded by the smell of rotten apples, broken socks and waste plastic. A cool breeze made me sway and it rained. I want to stand up, but I find that I have not formed yet. I sighed. Who can think that I was a towering tree that was sheltered from the wind and rain? Rain rained through my body. Through my chest, I saw the handwriting of the fate engraved on my back. &quot;I am a shooting star. I am flying in the night sky. Even if no one is sad for me, I still smile.&quot; I am a meteor, I am flying in the night sky, even if no one finds my trace, I also left memories.&quot; I am a piece of paper. Dawn is coming, my life as a paper is coming to an end. I will go through another test in the heat of the fire. I will turn into ashes. I will be smaller, lighter and more free. I will return to the land that once nurtured me. New seedlings will grow on me, they will be my next rebirth, and all I need is time. Life cycle, this is the case. The wind and rain stopped, a ray of sunshine illumined me, I am looking forward, I pray...", "id": "3004259319", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "5", "version": "183.0", "author": "\u5154\u53fd\u5f88\u725b\u63b0", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Facebook"}

"title_en": "registered", "content_en": "registration success. Put down the baggage, you can move forward lightly, in order to enjoy the pleasure of walking, you can go further in the direction you want to go. From birth to children, to teenagers, to youth, to adults, along the way, the burden of our bodies is getting more and more, our steps are getting heavier, and our pure and fresh souls are becoming more and more unrecognizable and exhausted. Unbearable, or even scarred. For many years, we have been walking on the road in a hurry. In fact, this road is not what we really want to go. It is suitable for one&#39;s own heart. It is more implied by others, or it is blindly imitated by oneself. Others learn piano and I also learn piano. Others take college, I also take college. Others go north and wide, and I follow closely. When others buy big houses, I don\u2019t want small houses. Others stocks, I also stocks... For the sake of name, for profit, for power, or for color, we are in a hurry, we are non-stop, we can&#39;t sleep at night, we even give up every Sunday that allows the body and soul to rest. Everything that could have come to listen to music and drink tea in the afternoon. We have no time to appreciate the glory of spring flowers, we have no time to listen to the frogs of summer nights, we have forgotten the moon and moon in the Mid-Autumn Festival, we can no longer sigh by the ancient poets in the face of the snow. We are the top, we are the flywheel, we have made so many machines that never stop, this is not enough, we have to turn ourselves into machines - machines that run at high speed, for the so-called good life. We are always too slow. We replaced our bicycles with bicycles, replaced bicycles with electric vehicles and motorcycles, replaced electric vehicles and motorcycles with cars, and then replaced the cars with airplanes. One day, will we replace the aircraft with rockets and spacecraft? If there is such a day, our feet and legs, which are so fast, are afraid that they have already degraded to not walk like ancestors. We are always too little. Clothes, we are always less new and popular. Food, we always have one less meal, less taste. Housing, we are always tens of square meters less than neighbors, relatives, classmates and friends. The salary is always too little, too little, too little compared to the bosses, too little compared to the stars, too little compared to the leaders, too little compared to the old guys or young people. We are always too old. The house is old, we have to change it. The car is old, we have to change it. The furniture is old, we have to change it. The bridge is old, we have to repair it. The lights are old, we are new. Only children, we do not like new and old. Only the wife, although the milfs are old, we have no thieves, and we dare not change. We always love it. Compared with classmates, people have made a fortune, and the remarried wife is more beautiful. Compared with friends, the children of the family went to Peking University and even studied in the United States. Compared with colleagues, everyone has a deputy senior title director level. Compared with the leadership, people take more meetings than me to start a meeting. Compared with the neighbors, why are the dogs and dogs obedient and cute... We think about it all day long, busy, and happy. In the end, it is hard to do so. Because it was difficult to do so, we were unhappy all day, not happy at all, not too chic. We were burdened with heavy burdens and were squeezed to the edge of the rivers and lakes. So we are bitter, we are tired, we blame everyone, we are indignant. However, our brains that are full of blood and desires are not calmly thinking about it: Why is this all? Is life that others want is the life I want? Is it true that all material desires are satisfied? Is it happy to have money? Is it famous to be happy? Have the right to be happy? I want to go a little further. Is it true that our ancestors slash and burn, ploughing horses, hungry wild fruits, thirsty drinking streams, living in earthen houses, and sleeping wood beds are not happy at all? Is Li Bai Du Fu Wang Wei Su Dongpo not a BMW luxury car high-speed rail, can not write a moving poetry can not draw a wonderful picture? And Tao Qian, who lives in Yuantianju, simply don&#39;t live? The villagers in the remote mountain areas have to jump to the river to kill themselves? The street shoemakers and car repairers should not be alive and frowning all year round? Think carefully, or our &quot;heart&quot; has a problem. What&#39;s the problem? - Want too much. Don&#39;t you want your own life? Want to regain the happiness that has been lost for a long time? From tomorrow onwards, completely let go of the burdens - the burdens imposed by others or on your own body, liberate yourself, find yourself, walk light, and live simple life. - It is a rabbit, don&#39;t be taller than a swan, as long as you run fast. - It is a monkey, don&#39;t compare it with an elephant, as long as it is smart and flexible enough. - Is a zebra, do not compare with the speed of the leopard, to love their unique markings. - It is a sparrow, so don&#39;t be more beautiful than a peacock, and keep the ordinary.", "id": "3003360685", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "5", "version": "183.0", "author": "\u5df4\u522b\u4e4b\u5854", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Facebook"}

Ah, ah. Through deep research on the climate and its impact, it is found that the climate is global, that is, the climate of the district is not only affected by local factors, but also by the global factors such as the global ocean, land and earth surface systems. Due to the complexity of climate influencing factors and the complex feedback and coupling relationships in each subsystem, climate simulations and predictions must include global oceans, snow, and land performance conditions and processes. The climate is not partial, but global. Many studies have shown that teleconnections in climatic phenomena are very common. For example, winter torrential rains on the west coast of the United States have a good correlation with SST anomalies in the eastern equatorial Pacific (ie, the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon); The change of hot salt circulation may be one of the important reasons for climate change. For another example, the Antarctic research of Chinese scientists shows that there is a close teleconnection between the changes of Antarctic sea ice and the precipitation in China during the flood season. These phenomena are difficult to understand using classical climatological knowledge, and the answer to the global climate system is obvious. In the past, climate was mainly seen as a problem of the atmosphere itself. Classical climatology believes that climate includes three basic elements, namely temperature (temperature), humidity (precipitation), pressure (surface pressure); climate formation has 3 Elements: solar radiation (geographic latitude and longitude), land and sea distribution and atmospheric circulation; if there is an average of 3 basic elements in 30 years, it can represent a local climate. With the development of science, these three basic concepts of classical climatology have been seriously challenged. People originally realized that the climate situation is different every year. However, the long-term statistical characteristics are constant, and the average of the climatic factor indicators obtained in 30 years is often used to represent the climate. Classical climatology believes that climate change is only a random fluctuation between years, but the research and development of earth science has long since broken through this concept. The glacial period and the interglacial period were discovered in geology. Later, various evidences such as sporopollen, tree rings, and historical records indicate that the climate has a time scale that is much longer than the 30-year scale. The region and the world have been in the past century. The major events of scale climate change have also made people deeply feel the climate is changing. The concept of the climate system was first proposed in the 1970s. The concept of this concept has deeply influenced the research and application of climate, and is of great significance to the development of climate models, making the climate model move to multiple levels of the atmosphere, ocean and land systems. The direction of mutual coupling of various processes has evolved. But in reality, the existing climate model has a long way to go before it is fully or fully coupled. The main methods of global climate change simulation, the rapid development of climate models and their widespread application are closely related to the issue of global change. In the past, the climate model was dominated by atmospheric physical processes. After the global change problem was raised, the climate model included multiple processes of biology, chemistry and human activities, which were more comprehensive and comprehensive. From the current development perspective, climate is not only a problem of the atmosphere itself, but also closely related to the environment and human activities. The presentation and application of the concept of global climate system is a progress and revolution in climatology, which gives us a deeper understanding of the climate. In application, various ocean circulation models, land surface process models and atmospheric circulation models are coupled with each other. It makes our simulations and predictions of climate more precise, and we are more aware of the processes that lead to climate dynamics and changes. The global climate system is of great value in our research and understanding of the interactions between the various systems of the Earth&#39;s surface systems, especially the environmental effects of land use and land cover on a macro scale that help us understand the impact of human activities. . [Global climate system research includes understanding of components, understanding of the process of change in each component, and understanding of the interactions and feedback processes between these components. (1) The atmosphere is the most unstable and rapidly changing component of this system. There are large and small circulation systems inside the atmosphere, which are the basic units that constitute climate change. The dry air on Earth now consists mainly of nitrogen, oxygen and ammonia. The sun&#39;s incidence has an effect on these gases, and the long-wave radiation emitted by the Earth has no effect on it. However, some trace gases, like carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and ozone, absorb and emit long-wave radiation, so they become greenhouse gases. Although they account for less than 0.1% of the volumetric mixing ratio of the atmosphere, they play a major role in the Earth&#39;s energy budget. The water vapor (H2O) contained in the atmosphere is also a natural greenhouse gas. The volume mixing ratio of water vapor varies with height, and the total amount does not exceed 1%. These greenhouse gases absorb long-wave radiation radiated from the Earth and radiate long-wave radiation to the outside (empty) and down (the Earth), resulting in an increase in the temperature of the Earth&#39;s surface. Water vapor, CO2 and O3 also absorb short-wave radiation. In addition to the above gases, the atmosphere contains solid and liquid plasmids (aerosols) and clouds, and their effects on incident and radiative radiation are complex and variable. One of the most varied is the phase change of water in the atmosphere, such as water vapor, cloud particles and ice crystals. Water vapor is the strongest greenhouse gas, and its phase transition can absorb or release a lot of energy. Therefore, water vapor plays an important role in climate change. The composition of the atmosphere changes with the evolution of the Earth and is particularly important for climate change over longer time scales. The atmospheric composition of the geological history is different and there is no life. When there is no life, N2 and O2 are less than now, CO2 is more than now, and trace gases increase with the appearance of life. The water vapor content in the atmosphere and the rate of water circulation vary with the temperature of the Earth at different times. (2) The hydrosphere is composed of all ground and groundwater, including rivers, lakes and underground freshwater, seawater. Through runoff, fresh water flows from rivers to the ocean and affects ocean composition and currents. The ocean covers about 70% of the Earth&#39;s surface. The ocean stores and transports large amounts of energy and decomposes and stores large amounts of CO2. The wind can drive ocean currents. The density gradient and thermal gradient of salt can also form a marine circulation, called the warm salt circulation. Due to the huge thermal inertia of the ocean, it has a great regulation effect on climate change and is also an important energy source for climate change. (3) The cryosphere includes Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, continental glaciers and plateau snow cover, sea ice and permafrost. About 10.6% of the world&#39;s land is covered by ice. The area of \u200b\u200bsea ice is larger than that of land ice, which accounts for 6.7% of the ocean area. The driving role of the cryosphere on climate change includes high reflectivity to solar radiation, low heat transfer, and large thermal inertia, especially its changes (fresh water injection and heat exchange) can drive deep sea circulation and change atmospheric circulation through morphology. The ice caps in the polar regions store large amounts of water, and their volume changes (ice cap growth and melting) are potential sources of sea level change. The polar regions can also influence the balance of greenhouse gases through permafrost. The albedo of the cryosphere is 7-9, and the average land is 0.3. The monthly mean snow cover and sea ice area distribution in the northern hemisphere observed by satellites was the largest in December and the smallest in August. (4) The Earth&#39;s biosphere includes marine life and terrestrial life. The biosphere has an impact on atmospheric composition, and its importance is that organisms can directly convert and release greenhouse gases. Through photosynthesis, marine and terrestrial plants, especially forests, can convert CO2 and store enough carbon. Thus, the biosphere plays an important role in the cycle of carbon cycling and other gases such as CH4 and N2O. Other organic volatile components have an effect on atmospheric chemistry and also affect aerosol formation and climate change. As the climate affects the storage of carbon and the exchange of trace gases, this will result in a feedback process between climate change and trace gas concentrations. The role of climate in the biosphere will be recorded in fossils, tree rings, and pollen, making it a biological indicator or climate proxy for past climate change. (5) The fifth component of the global climate system is the land surface. Vegetation and soil on the land surface can affect the amount of solar energy that is reached, and this energy will eventually be given to the atmosphere. The part that heats the atmosphere warms the ground in the form of long-wave radiation, and some of the heat is used to evaporate water and enter the atmosphere. Due to the energy required for the evaporation of soil moisture, wet soils also have a large effect on the surface temperature. The roughness of the land surface changes the wind on the surface, affecting the dynamic characteristics of the atmospheric boundary layer and the exchange of geogas. Among the various land types on the land, grassland and desert account for 50%, farmland and human land account for 10% to 13%, forests account for 23% to 33%, and frozen soil and wetland account for 8% to 12%.

"title_en": "registered", "content_en": "Why can&#39;t I register, I always have a network error, I heard that I have to write a comment to register. It is still the same to write. How can I register successfully? It seems that the comments written can not be sent out. Some time ago, my friend told me that a girl she knew committed suicide. &quot;Her life is too bitter. When she was very young, her mother abandoned their sisters and brothers. When I was in high school, my father died of serious illness. Then the two younger brothers lost their ability to live because of a car accident. The reason why she is every day I worked hard in the early days to earn more money to take care of my family.\u201d I have seen this girl, a very extroverted girl, who is very embarrassed and has a good hand. She especially likes to read books. She can talk about poetry and poetry to the philosophy of life. You can also talk to you about mysterious outer space and the most popular jokes of the moment. You don&#39;t even see that things that can be crushed by one person are happening to her. &quot;After going through a decade like this, maybe she is really tired. I can do stupid things when I can&#39;t think of it. Fortunately, I came back from the rescue. Fortunately.&quot; I listened to a long breath, although this is The story of others is not the epitome of life. People&#39;s life is so long, many things will be uninvited when they don&#39;t say a word, and there will be a lot of unbearable life weight on our shoulders. If you don&#39;t have a strong heart, you can barely walk. Through this life. In that life, what is a really strong inner heart? A strong inner person, only live at my own pace, I have a cousin, still in a single state when I was 30 years old. Parents are worried that she can&#39;t get married. Many people have said to her: &quot;It&#39;s almost enough, don&#39;t pick too much.&quot; She hasn&#39;t wavered since she insisted for a long time: &quot;Is it right to find someone to marry?&quot; But last year she finally met her favorite half, she liked him, and a year later, she got married. On the wedding day, she said: &quot;I always believe that I will meet the right person. It is not too late for 30 years old. Life is just beginning.&quot; Yes, 20 to 30 years old, we are always afraid that everything is too late, friends of the same age are early. As for the promotion and salary increase, you will embark on a small peak in life, and you are still working hard to work overtime until late at night; otherwise, others will get married early and have children, step into the so-called &quot;correct&quot; life track, and you will even be in the other half. I don\u2019t know where I am; I can only go to a public hospital for a long time when I am sick, and I can enjoy the best service when I go to a private hospital. The children in the future can\u2019t even get a degree from a public school. Private international school... It seems that everything is slow, it seems that nothing compares. &quot;It\u2019s too late to catch up!&quot; So, when you see someone else studying in class, you immediately chase after the registration, for fear of falling to the next step; seeing others find a good job, you also think about whether you want to resign and find a better one; Traveling to other countries around the world, you are thinking, whether you want to resign as a travel blogger is good... However, blindly following the life track of others, will not welcome your ideal life. The world is panicking, and your heart is chaotic. Strong people in the heart never judge themselves by outside standards. They have their own rhythm and know when to do something. They clearly know what they want, know that they will face many choices and variables, so each time they choose to follow their own heart, they only need to work hard and wait quietly, everything will come naturally. A strong inner man, dare to walk out of the comfort zone, the recent hot movie &quot;I am not a drug god&quot; in the role of Lv benefit, Wang Chuanjun, so that the audience is completely eye-catching. After everyone walked out of the theater, they were moved by his performance and said: &quot;Wang Chuanjun is no longer the magic of Guan Gu.&quot; But what we don&#39;t know is that when I took the meal, Wang Chuanjun ate 44 buns and spit two. Then, I ate 5 bowls of noodles that night. In order to play a good leukemia patient, he was very thin. He insisted on jumping 8,000 times a day, not sleeping in the hospital for two nights, losing 20 pounds. Ming Ming starred in &quot;Love Apartment&quot; can easily make money, but Wang Chuanjun chose Lu benefiting such a role to work hard? The reason is very simple: he does not want to do &quot;Guangu magic&quot; anymore, he wants to be better Wang Chuanjun. So he went to the drama workshop to help people read the script for free and to report to the director class. So everyone remembered the &quot;Romantic Death History&quot;, he played the nameless Ma Zi on the beach: keep long hair, store a beard, speak the standard Shanghai dialect, vicious and human. However, many fans did not buy it. They missed the magic of Guan Gu, and even gave him a message: &quot;Can you take a picture of love 5 and give us an explanation?&quot; &quot;Shave the beard, cut the hair, and continue to be our Guan Gu. But he said: &quot;Be what you want to be, don&#39;t be what they want. Of course, the stability of the world is very comfortable, but there are always many people like Wang Chuanjun in the world. They prefer the uneven road because they know that the comfort zone in life is like a comfortable pigsty. Once they fall into it. It seems to be quite good, there are food, drink, and mud, but all the comforts need to be paid. Life is changing. When the change comes, people who never dare to walk out of the comfort zone are lost in the pigsty. The poor worms of combat power can only wait quietly for being eliminated. The reason why the inner strong people will never encounter the shackles and collapses is because they deeply understand the truth of the survival of the fittest, even if they know that they will suffer and question, they I will make great strides forward and never look back. Strong people are good at subtraction. I am a typical woman who likes to pick up hands. For example, if I want to spend a few minutes for breakfast, I bought a bread machine, coffee machine, and use. There are only a handful of times; for example, if you want to learn to make snacks and buy an oven, unfortunately, it has not been successfully released; for example, visiting supermarkets to see good dishes and The bowl, but found that there is no chance to let them play; for example, &quot;there is always a piece of clothing in the closet&quot;, so whether it is not suitable, as long as the good-looking can not afford to pay the hand to buy, the result is still unable to find every day Clothes that I thought to improve the quality of life, but made my life more and more crowded and messy. I rereaded Liu Yu\u2019s &quot;Send You a Bullet&quot; some time ago, which wrote: &quot;Every person&#39;s identity is A self-abduction, only loss is the way to freedom. Suddenly I realized that the circle of friends is very precious. I should leave it to those who really care about it. So I deleted some unfamiliar people who didn\u2019t know at all. I suddenly felt relaxed. I thought about everything I wanted to move to at home, just because There is a lack of security. The reason why people with strong inner strengths know how to break away from life and subtract from life is because they accept themselves from the heart. They understand that security is to be given by themselves, not by items. In &quot;Love and Love&quot;, my favorite character is Azu, who is a victim of marriage. When her husband was alive, she was alone in her hometown. After she died, she kept his grave, and even made a coffin waiting early. He was buried. She was all planning, but she did not expect her husband to re-establish a family in the city. Yue Huiying was the daughter born after the reorganization of the family. She insisted on transferring her father\u2019s grave to the city and was buried with her mother. Azu did not agree to move to the grave. She believed that her husband loved her. One person stubbornly confronted the migrating team that had poured into the village. There was no fear. Until the end of the movie. She finally saw the photo of her husband living with other women. The photo was full of happiness. It was something she had never had. She relieved and agreed to move the grave. On the day of the grave, Azu\u2019s remains on her husband\u2019s remains. Said one sentence: &quot;I don&#39;t want you anymore. &quot;Azu, who has been strong for a lifetime, has the courage to fight the world and the perseverance to face the lonely life, but still retreats in the face of love. It is better to say that she retreats in the face of love. Makes her stronger, and this is the ultimate in strength, or love. Does a person&#39;s inner strength mean that the heart has become hard? Not like this. Nothing is more magical than gentle, the more powerful People tend to be more gentle. People with strong inner feelings have experienced the baptism of life and have seen life. They know that tears and anger are useless to solve things. The claws and claws are exposed to fragility. Only gentleness and peace are the contradictions and griefs. Strength. I always believe that the power of human beings never depends on the body and the material, but on the heart. A person can only easily shake you and knock you down if he is strong inside. May you be a strong person inside. Bravely resist the torrent of life.", "id": "3003194506", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "5", "version": "183.0", "author": "Angel\u73b2\u5152", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Facebook"}

I don&#39;t know if the comment is true. I have been showing network problems. My friend has an account that can&#39;t log in. I can&#39;t see the account. It&#39;s all network problems. The Emperor of the Han Dynasty re-emphasized the country, and Yu Yu could not ask for it for many years. The Yang family has grown up as a woman, and she is not known to her. Natural beauty is difficult to give up, once chosen on the side of the king. Looking back at a smile, Bai Meisheng, Liu Gongfen no color. Spring cold baths Huaqing pool, hot spring water wash gel. The waiter helped the young and weak, and it was the time when the new Cheng Enze. Yunxiaohua Yanjin stepping, Furong account warmth spring. Spring is bitter and short, and the king is not early. Cheng Huan\u2019s banquet has no leisure time, and the spring is from the spring night. Three thousand people in the harem, three thousand pets in love. Jinwu makeup became a charming night, and the jade banquet was drunk and spring. Sisters and brothers are all in the land, and the poor light is the gateway to life. The order of the parents of the world, not reborn male reborn women. The high point of the palace is in Qingyun, and the fairy music is everywhere. Slow-song and slow-moving condensed silk bamboo, the king of the day is not enough. Yu Yangyu agitated and stunned the neon feathers. Jiuzhong City is famous for its smoke and dust. Tsui Wah swayed and went back to the west for more than a hundred miles. The Sixth Army did not help but succumb to the death of the moth. The flower garden has no one to accept, and the Cuiqiao Jinque jade head. The king can&#39;t save his face and look back at the blood and tears. The yellow scent is sloppy and the wind is sorrowful. There are few people in the mountains, and the flag is thin and thin. The Lancang River is surrounded by mountains and blue waters. The palace was saddened by the moon, and the night rain smelled the bells. Turning back to Long Yao, I can&#39;t go here. In the soil under the slopes of Ma Rong, there is no death in Yu Yan. The monarch and the minister are all intimately attached to each other. Returning to the pool is still the same, too liquid hibiscus Weiyang Liu. Hibiscus is like a face like a brow, how to not tears on this. The spring breeze and plum blossoms bloom, and the autumn rain leaves fall. There are many autumn grasses in the west palace, and the leaves are full of red. The pear garden disciple is white-new, and the pepper house is a young man. The eve of the phoenix flying quietly quietly, the lonely lamp did not sleep. Late in the long night, the Xing Xing River wants to smash the sky.\u9e33\u9e2f \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7 \u51b7Long life and death, other years, the soul has never come to dream. Linyi Taoist Hongdu guest, can be sincere to soul. In order to rethink the king, I believe that the alchemist is diligent. Emptying the suffocating rushing like electricity, ascending to heaven and seeking it. On the poor, the blue sky fell, and neither of them was seen. Suddenly there are fairy mountains on the sea, and the mountains are in vain. The pavilion is exquisite and five clouds rise, and there are many fairies. One of the characters is too true, and the snowy skin is uneven. Jin Yu Xi Xiang Yu Yuxi, transfer Xiaoyu Bao Shuangcheng. I heard the emperor of the Han family, and the dream of Jiuhua\u2019s account was shocked. The pillow is pushed up and the silver screen of the bead is opened. The clouds are half-new and sleep, and the corolla does not come down. The wind blows the fairy, and it looks like a neon feather dance. Yu Rong is lonely and tears dry, and a pear blossoms with spring rain. With love and enthusiasm, Xie Junwang, a different voice. The Zhaoyang Temple is full of love, and the Penglai Palace is long and long. Looking back at people, I don\u2019t see Chang\u2019an seeing the dust. Only the old things will be sentimental, and the alloy will be sent. One share of one is reserved, and the gold is divided into two. But the heart of the church is like Jin Jinjian, and the heavens and the earth will meet each other. Parting and diligently reposting the words, there are vows in the words. On the 7th of July, the Hall of Life, when no one was whispering in the night. In the day of the wish to be a lovebird, in the land is willing to be a branch. It\u2019s a long time and a long time, and this hate is endless.", "id": "3001989285", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "4", "version": "182.0", "author": "\u5416\u6636", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Facebook"}

"title_en": "Registration problem", "content_en": "I don&#39;t know if this long paragraph can pass. Spring eyebrows, the exhibition of the season of Gu Panmo thousands of trees and cherry blossoms, one of the subtle faces, on the wake of the branches, revealing a panicked expression. This tree flies, the spring is in a hurry, the breeze blows gently, the green sleeves are dyed, I write lightly, apply a piece of ink and smoke on the plains, cling to the branches of the years, show the season Gu Pan. \u2014\u2014Inscription Spring of Huai Yanyan is a plain brush, embellished with natural scrolls, ink painting Jiangnan understatement; is a green dress goddess, windy smile, waiting for you under the scent of cherry blossoms, slowly approaching... It towed the skirt, so half-town smoke sand, full of spring. It walked through the graceful steps, intoxicated, and filled our vision, and entered the April world. Shu Shujiao eyes, green water lingering around the white wall, rain hitting the green tile, through the pile of embankment, watching the ten-year-old weeping willow, every leaf, was washed green and dripping. The mountain peaks are covered with lush outerwear, and a soft and scornful scorn is rising in the distance. Spring water, stumbling down the mountain road, joy and embarrassment. At this time, I am like a swaying water grass, in the cycle of the season, ups and downs, but never annihilated the green dream, and like a fish hidden in the bottom of the pool, in the depths of memory, free to squat. Hold the warmth of the spring, spread the romance of the summer, let the autumn cool, bathe the winter sun, and pass the four seasons of life, all the way to feel the scenery, all the way to the horizon. In fact, life is nothing more than a trek, passing through a heavy mountain, passing through a road of water, carrying all the way to the warmth, on the way to the road, collecting the sweet song of Yange, storing one meter of sunshine in the morning, drunk and poetic After the sunset, watching a snowflake dance, Su Rui is quiet. In the branches that come every season, the hope of the exhibition season, through the flowery words of the years, the heartstrings of the shore, and a fragrant kiss. The spring breeze plucks the phantom of the distant mountains; the clouds are flowing, and the gentleness of April is warm. Willow sticks to the waves, dances the soft green screen, the indigo-colored lotus leaves, and the light wind at the bottom of the sleeves, sweeping across the lake, stacking layers of clear lotus. You see, the trees are full of trees, the flowers are embroidered, and you laugh, you laugh, you hear, the wind outside the window bursts like a slang word; you smell, the wild leaves on the stranger are fragrant. Spring is destined to be a kind of romantic charm, a very romantic poetry. The silent land, I heard countless subtle joints, this year, will it be a good year for a good weather? Between the waters and the sky, the clouds are colorful. I walked from the romantic flowers and put on a pleasant mood. I sat in the spring leisurely, letting the time wrap around the fingertips, and the sleeves were warm and warm, and the letter pen opened a piece of ink. Come and go with the wind, the pen goes flying, writes a whisper of a special year, dyes a painting of smoke and rain, quietly settles in the heart, for a glimpse of the light of nostalgia. Therefore, the dark and fragrant flower buds brew a deep and introverted text, and the screens are separated by a time, distant from the landscape, and the occasional acquaintance is a spiritual contract. I am in the sky of the southern country, showing the hope of the season. It is so lucky to count the dusk of every cloud in the moon, to talk about dreams, and to think about it. Spring duck head, spring shirt parrot mouth, in the south of the light smoke fresh water, along the path of the flat, from the depths of the red dust, with a shadow, all the way to find. Look at the gentleness of the Jiangnan woman&#39;s bow, the shyness of the water lotus, and the red sleeves that are laughing, the smile of a clean and dusty smile, a soft and graceful mood, warming each other&#39;s Chinese. I am full of sake, and you look at the flowers, and gently smear the clouds of the world, let the text dance in the pens; for you to weave a dream of the glory of the ancient glory, \u7efe \u6210 \u6d01 \u6d01 \u6d01 \u6d01 \u6d01Play a mountain stream and meet the sound of the sound, for you to clean up the dusty sky. The spring years, thanks to life, this beautiful encounter, casually met. You are love, warm, hope, you are my April day. The red dust has dreams, the years are boundless, the seasons that come and go in a hurry, the hustle and bustle of the glitz and vicissitudes of life, it is always difficult to retain, in this watery and profitable life, those thoughts bloom like flowers, in how many cold windows autumn moonlight night Drunk and smoked, you sing low and sing, in the dream of Zi Mo warm, a deep affection. I am lightly draped in the feathers, all the way to the rain, all the way to the flowers, all the way to pursue. The green branches, the exhibition of the hope of the season, the trajectory of the heart extends along the direction of the dream, but I don\u2019t know how the smoke is lingering, the trees are reflected, how many red dusts are painted in the picturesque mountains, and how many broken sausages are buried. Past events? I don\u2019t understand the depth of spring, I can\u2019t wave my love for the dust, and when it\u2019s clear and rainy, I\u2019m screaming and screaming into the town. Look at the green dragonfly, the flowers are full of spring soil, and the butterfly is in the dust of love. In April, the empty wilderness rolled up a green carpet, and looked at it with a glance. The villager, the shepherd boy who sheltered from the rain, rang on the back of the cow and blew the whistle. And I, cut a window of smoke, sleep on one side of the ancient \u781a, in the text, fragrant, looking for you. At this time, like a swaying water grass, over the embankment of the season, doing green dreams, such as a blue bird, stranded in the waters of Acacia, showing the hope of the season... Spring eyebrows, green clouds, I am lightly dyed The blush of peach blossoms, the fragrant scent of the blue lotus, picking the softness of the willow green, the life of an amphibious flower, keeping the heart warm, let it calm and innocent, as warm as ever. Walking in the red dust of sorrow and joy, showing the hope of the season, collecting the ethereal spirit of the wilderness, collecting the delicate scenery of the lake, depicting the appearance of the water, waiting for a know, and obsessing the Qinghuan. The blue waters of the lake, by the fingers of the wind, played into a late folk song, light and light music, filled with empty evening. The sound of the birds that wet in the spring rain fell into the lake with a bead and a bead. The waves of ripples bloomed in the heart of the spring lake. The fisherman who wears a cloak makes a pair of wood pulp, knocks on a single wave of flowers, plows a poem of a ridge and a ridge, and quietly recites the poetry of spring. Another year is Qingming, that spring rain, drenching the ancient heart, lonely red dust inn, do not ask people to gather, thousands of miles of rain. In the suburbs, who is burning incense to worship the ancestors and remember the old people? Whose sleeves are lightly blown by the breeze? Spring eyebrows, smooth when looking at the fingertips, I used to write a light ink on the plain. Surging and faint, quietly watching, cutting a window of smoke, feeling the warmth of the world, looking for you in the fragrance of the text, show the expectations of the season.", "id": "3001851245", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "5", "version": "182.0", "author": "\ud83d\udc51\ud83c\udf90\ud83d\udc8d\ud83c\udf8c\ud83c\udf93\ud83d\udcab\ud83c\udf8e\ud83c\udf88", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Facebook"}
