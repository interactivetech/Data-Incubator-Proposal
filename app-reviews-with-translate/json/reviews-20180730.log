I was in Miami I tried using Lyft my driver said they had picked me up and never picked me up I tried calling but no answer. And they just drove off saying they were in route to my destination. Canceled the ride and got charged a fee! I order another one and it did the same thing. Idk what\u2019s going on with Lyft but this is unacceptable as a company!!!", "id": "2993635657", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "1", "version": "5.38.3", "author": "IdcCauseIrdc", "country": "US", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Lyft"}

The picture and style of the Chinese style and the dubbing of the first chapter of the plot are very attractive to me. The feeling of the partner who has played the chicken is whether the experience is good enough and whether the reality is strong enough. Players will start to download several similar ones for comparison, such as the whole army, wilderness and so on. No more than I don&#39;t know, some pictures and characters make it feel unreal. Stimulate the overall feeling and the PC end more. There are also some shortcomings in the world. It may take time to optimize and iterate. If you can add some windows to knock out the glass, and when you shoot the wall, you will feel more broken. The land came to the foot of Yanshan, perhaps not only because of fate, but also a natural yearning for the geographical mountains and rivers of the motherland. It is said that one side of the water and soil raises one person, not the place itself, but the person who misses the place and the one in the past. Yes, we have our own youth in the place where we leave, with tears and happy laughter. How can I not miss it? It is said that people are rational animals, but if they can pass this life emotionally, who will choose rationally? This is the helplessness of reality, the irreconcilable contradiction, and the clarion call. We always have to carry our own bags on our own, go to the distance to find ourselves or find ourselves in the distance from where they are annoyed to where others are annoying. This sentence may not be a lot of fun in life. I always need to dig myself to explore and come here. I always want to maintain a fresh mood, because staying in one place for a long time will make the place too familiar. There is no desire to explore, so there will be a lot less fun. The north in my imagination should be the appearance of Linhai Xueyuan. In the winter, there is a lot of snow outside the house, but the room is very warm. People are playing cards and watching TV. A happy mirror came here and I found out that it is not It\u2019s all I think. Life here seems to be the same as life in the South, but if you can savor it, you can still find a lot of differences. For example, the architectural style here is generally tall and the color is a bit single. There are more mountains here. But the stream is relatively small. People here use more of this. The South is exactly the opposite.", "id": "2994724339", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "5", "version": "13.29", "author": "\ud83d\udc9d\u91ce\u65f7\u5929\u4f4e\u6811", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Youtube"}

It is the product of the development of human history in childhood and the precedent of literature. The myth is based on the low level of productivity in ancient times and the positive demands of people to understand nature and dominate nature in order to strive for survival and increase production capacity. Myths originated in the ancient times of mankind. As one of the sources of folk literature, it is a powerful proof that the working people have always been the creators of spiritual civilization, and also revealed that folk literature has been closely related to the people&#39;s life and history from the very beginning. The essence of myth is that any myth uses imagination and imagination to conquer natural forces, to control natural forces, and to visualize natural forces; myths are natural and social forms that have been processed through unconscious artistic methods through the imagination of the people. . As a form of folk literature, mythology is a highly imaginative story created by the people of ancient times that reflects the relationship between nature, man and nature, and social form. The creation of myths is combined with the struggle of primitive human beings for nature to survive. At that time, production was based on simple, unpredictable natural forces that pose a serious threat to humanity. At the same time, the primitive people&#39;s understanding of the objective world is also at an extremely naive stage. They are confused, amazed and panicked by the operation of the sun and the moon, the change of day and night, the occurrence of floods and droughts, and the death and death of old people. Natural phenomena such as these are closely related to the production and life of primitive human beings. They are eager to understand nature, so they rely on themselves to imagine that everything in the heavens and the earth is the same as human beings, with life and will; the process of natural phenomena And causality, but also the assumptions and fantasies of human form, and that everything in nature is dominated by the inspired God. Under the control of this thought, all natural objects and natural forces are deified. The primitive people did not want to give in, and they unremittingly struggled with nature, eager to understand nature, conquer nature, reduce labor, and guarantee life. They turned this will and desire into a concrete image and a vivid plot through unconscious imagination, and thus there was a myth. It can be seen that mythology is a spiritual activity in which the primitive people attempt to understand nature and control nature under the extremely difficult conditions.", "id": "2993483692", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "5", "version": "182.0", "author": "\u8fd9\u68f5\u7c97\u597d\u8471", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Facebook"}

"title_en": "registered", "content_en": "Water is dignified and light; the mountain is calm and strong. Let&#39;s just say that, how can you say? Let&#39;s analyze the constellation meaning of &quot;water&quot; (water represents water) and &quot;soil&quot; (soil represents mountain). I like to analyze the constellation. One of the classifications of the constellation is divided into four categories: fire, water, earth and wind. Just say water and earth. &quot;Water&quot; (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) is a liquid element. There are many things and meanings related to water, such as water is one of the necessary conditions for the survival of living things on the earth; the ocean composed of water takes up most of the surface area, and many organisms also contain a lot of water, including humans. . Water is the only one of all elements that can be converted from a liquid to a gaseous or solid state, but as with fire, the process of transitioning from one state to another is consistent and stable. In the Tao Te Ching, Lao Tzu mentioned that water flows down and nourishes everything. The essence of water is incomparably supple and can be accommodated in vessels of any shape; but when it encounters obstacles, it can pass through the stone. \u201cSoil\u201d (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) is a solid element, and there are many things and meanings related to soil, such as the earth, and the land that breeds everything; and in the ecological environment in which we live, except the ocean and the atmosphere. In addition, the most important thing is the land, and this large piece of land is made up of &quot;soil.&quot; The state of the soil is quite stable and difficult to change, but the minerals and compounds that are rich in it will change from time to place. Water is dignified, but the color is constant. These constellations usually care for feelings and memories for decades. The soil (mountain) is calm, but the colors are ever-changing. These constellations also have their own unique sense of humor. And romantic. People say that the benevolent Leshan, the wise man is happy, this should be two feelings. I don&#39;t have any wisdom, but because it is a water sign, I naturally have a good impression on water. I prefer the water that can be put into any kind of container, but it doesn&#39;t change its own characteristics. This is quite like the people in today&#39;s society. There are countless kinds of appearances on the outside, but they always insist on their own ideals and pursuits. The mountain, in my opinion, is the kind of person who is very proud and lonely. They are filled with rich emotions that are unwilling to be exposed. They also deeply need love and appreciation, but he (or she) will not go. Ask someone to give it. Therefore, they stand there like two mountains, shoulder to shoulder, longing for human care or friendship, but they are stubbornly resisting other people&#39;s proposals for friendship or open love. They also have many emotions and sorrows that ordinary people cannot understand, but they are summed up in four categories: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. In the spring, the trees are green, the flowers are blooming, the summer is greener, the autumn is golden, the winter is white, and the snow is mixed with dead grass... Poor guys. Let us imagine when the mountain meets the water. When the water is flowing in the embrace of the mountain. What kind of scene is that? In spring, the trees on the hills are green, and the water reflects the growth of the mountains; in the summer, the water sends joy to the mountains; in autumn, the trees on the hills bear fruit, the mountains (water) reflect the joy of the mountains; in winter, the water comes to accompany the loneliness of the mountains. . How good this feeling is, the Astrology book also writes that when the &quot;water&quot; elephant and the &quot;earth&quot; (mountain) elephant love each other, both people can understand each other&#39;s beauty and suffering, the landscape, and what else More beautiful than pure and innocent?", "id": "2991194790", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "5", "version": "182.0", "author": "\u5d14\u897f\u6709", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Facebook"}
