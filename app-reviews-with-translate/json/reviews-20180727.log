I would absolutely love it if the developers could add a couple items to make it even more enjoyable and entertaining to use which could give it a better rating in the App Store. So first, everybody knows how hard it is to get the filter to actually go on your pets face because an animal face looks nothing like a human face. So what if there was a feature that the filters actually seek out an animals face? Like say when you go to one of the filters, there is an option; either human or animal and so you could easily get super cute, funny, or stylish filters on your already adorable animals. Secondly, this is kinda a copy off of Facebook, Instagram, etc. but Snapchat live. Like you could go live and people could see you real time just like Instagram, but make it to where you could use filters just like when you are video chatting with someone inside your personal chat or even in the group chats. This would make the app more interactive because the only way to get a message across to almost everyone is to send a picture to everyone in your contact list, or post it on your story where nobody gets notified if you actually post there(which is stupid and you should have an option to get notified when someone posts on their story).

not violate the teacher&#39;s rules. As a student, we should completely obey the teacher&#39;s words, and I did not pay much attention to the teacher&#39;s words this time. I am very sorry, I hope the teacher can forgive my mistakes. My regrets are really profound. However, people always make mistakes. Of course, I know that I can&#39;t use this as an excuse. We still try to avoid such mistakes. I hope the teacher can believe my remorse. &quot;There are people who have lost their hands and the horses have lost their hoofs.&quot; My bad behavior is not to challenge the teacher&#39;s discipline. Absolutely a mistake, the teacher said that the words are correct, that is, if you want to make mistakes, you should not make mistakes in front of you. I feel really embarrassed, how can this be so. I believe that the teacher\u2019s attitude towards me can also know that I have a very deep regret on this incident. I attach such importance to this incident and hope that the teacher can forgive my mistakes. I can assure the teacher that it will not be in the future. I will gossip about early self-study and any other classes. Today, I really understand my mistake very deeply. I know that what the teacher said should be listened to. The teacher\u2019s words will definitely fulfill her promise. The teacher must manage the students for our students, so we don\u2019t have to challenge the teacher. Discipline, we are still students, the inability to express the disobedience of the words spoken to the teacher, the only thing our students can do is to listen to the teacher&#39;s words, study well, so that the teacher can be assured that the teacher can trust. Making such mistakes is also a big blow to parents&#39; expectations of me. Parents earning money hard, so that our children can live a better life, so that we can devote ourselves to learning, but I am against it. The parents\u2019 minds, I made such mistakes, it is simply a denial of the parents\u2019 efforts. I feel very embarrassed about this. The parents\u2019 fatigue is something we don\u2019t know. Every day, we are busy for survival and bear huge for the family. The pressure, all of this is something we can&#39;t understand. The only thing we can do is to be their embarrassing child. Listening to the words of the parents, the parents are our closest relatives, and we are the most trustworthy in our society. People, so we must try to avoid parents being angry and not giving them unnecessary troubles. And we as their closest relatives can&#39;t provoke them to be angry. This is mutual. When we hurt their hearts, it is also hurting our own hearts, because we are the closest people. No one can replace it. I really feel sorry for this incident. I hope that the teacher can forgive me. I can recognize my attitude of admitting mistakes. I have really profoundly reflected on my mistakes. I hope that the teacher will give me the opportunity to change my mistakes. I also hope that my classmates should also take the lead and not make mistakes like me. The lessons of this time are really big. The nature of the error is serious. I spoke gossip in class and influenced other classmates. The result hurts many interests and has a very bad influence in school. This kind of behavior, even if it does not affect classroom discipline, is still wrong, and the move itself is contrary to the principle of being a student. I just took care of my own moments and thoughts, and completely ignored the teacher&#39;s feelings. This is also wrong. People are social people. Everyone should not just think about themselves. I am doing this. The one who is hurting is the classmates who spoke with me. I am doing this. It seems to be very good with him. Actually, it is Kill him. Moreover, speaking gossip during class is also a disrespect for the teacher. Therefore, the teacher asked me to write a review, which is also to let me deeply understand this point. Secondly, the act of telling gossip during class is also a manifestation of disrespect for the teacher&#39;s work. China is a state of ceremonies. Since ancient times, it has been a matter of respecting teachers. This is a traditional virtue. I have ignored it in the past. Aside from the level, not only the teacher, we should respect him, respect his labor, and the fruits of his labor. In doing so, it directly caused the bad influence of not respecting the teacher, not respecting others, and not respecting the labor of others. As a contemporary high school student, a person who is being educated, this performance obviously does not meet the social requirements for us. Again, my behavior has caused a bad influence among school classmates and undermined the image of the school. Students should learn from each other, promote each other, and have good discipline. My performance has brought a bad head to the students, which is not conducive to the school&#39;s style of study. At the same time, it also caused some damage to the image of the school. &quot;The Eighth Middle School&quot; has always been an academically rigorous school in people&#39;s minds. We should maintain this image instead of destroying it! Although I wrote the answer to other students during the exam, this is cheating. I have a good relationship with that classmate. He talked to me. At that time, I also wanted to speak and thought that the teacher would not find the luck. The consequences of the present. Although being a good person is the fine traditional virtue of the Chinese nation, it is the quality that contemporary middle school physiology should have. But now I am acutely aware that this is not about being good. I am goingssip about gossip in class, but also infect other students. This is not really good with others, but it is harming myself and my classmates. Late self-study is a class for students to review one day of study, no matter what the reason is. Gossip in class is very wrong, contrary to the principle of being a student. Of course, I can&#39;t say that I was going to talk to other students to talk about gossip in class. This is not a reason for me to cheat. Mr. Lu Xun said: Unfriendly help is malicious harm. Only by seriously reflecting on me, looking for the deep roots behind the mistakes, and recognizing the nature of the problem, can we give the collective and ourselves a confession and thus progress. As a student, I didn&#39;t do my own job. I should have never gossip when I was in class, but I spoke gossip during class and lived up to the teacher&#39;s usual education. My teacher has a hard time. Knowledge teaches us that we want to be a useful person to society, but I am telling gossip in class and deceiving knowledge to teach our teachers unselfishly. I have now fully realized that my behavior has not only failed to help. The purpose of the classmates is to harm him and to be a deceptive behavior to the teacher. Since I accepted the teacher\u2019s criticism of me, I have deeply realized the seriousness of this matter. The teacher taught me that the teacher is very concerned. I, love me, so I will listen to the teacher&#39;s words in the future, fully understand the teacher&#39;s request for us, and promise that there will be no similar things happening. If other students are talking to me during class, I will not participate anymore. It is not right to tell him that it is wrong, so that the teacher can help the teacher to worry, and help the teacher to create a good atmosphere for learning. I hope that the teacher will give me the opportunity to rehabilitate myself. The teacher hopes that we will become the pillars of society. Therefore, I will work harder in the study and life of the school in the future. I will not only learn the knowledge that the teacher teaches us, but also learn how to be a good person and do a right thing. Socially useful people, a righteous person, a good student who makes the teacher feel relieved, the teacher is as selfless as the parents\u2019 love for us, so I also want to carry forward the teacher\u2019s selfless spirit to us. Through this matter, I am deeply I feel that the teacher\u2019s feelings of hating iron and steel are not serious. The nature of the mistakes I made is serious. My gossip during class is actually a very bad influence on the class and the department. This unscrupulous behavior, even if the teacher allows it, is in itself a violation of the morality of the students and the spirit of concentration, and violates the principle of fair competition. Such an extremely wrong behavior is typical of the standardism. Especially in a generation of teenagers like me in the 21st century. Carrying forward the hard work spirit of the Eighth Middle School, it is both my responsibility and my unswerving direction to go the way of tenacious struggle and enterprising. However, my behavior runs counter to one another. A good and motivated student must of course strive for good results, but can&#39;t achieve it by desperately and unscrupulously. This is a major principle issue concerning how to be an adult and how to become a talent. The growth and progress of a person is not only the improvement of academics, but more importantly, the cultivation and tempering of ideas and styles. I have neglected such an important problem and made a directional mistake for this. The impact of my mistakes is very bad. Gossip in class, directly in class, directly affects the bad influence of disrespecting classmates, disrespecting teachers, and not respecting parents. In the past, the eighth middle school not only had good grades and good ideas, but also enjoyed a good reputation in terms of spiritual outlook, team discipline, academic construction, etc., and because of my mistakes, it greatly damaged the image of a certain middle school; originally, the teacher It is very important to me. However, my mistakes have deeply hurt their hearts; the mistakes I made have undoubtedly had a great negative impact and brought a bad head; other students are in the process of their growth. Among them, because of my mistakes, they have brought undue negative effects and unbearable ideological pressure. In short, they are deeply saddened and regretted by all the mistakes they have made. The mistakes and lessons I have made are profound. The teachers at the higher level and the classmates are entrusted with heavy responsibilities and high hopes. I have always felt that the responsibility is not great, and I study hard and fully invest. However, it turns out that it is not enough to be enthusiastic, hard-working, and study hard. It must also have a clear political mind, a sense of overall situation, and a sense of discipline. Otherwise, it will lose direction in learning and cause losses to the country and schools. I know that in order to cause such a large loss, I must bear the responsibility that cannot be afforded, especially for those who are educated in key universities. In this error, we should bear the main responsibility that cannot be shirked. I sincerely accept criticism and are willing to accept it. For all of this, I will further summarize and deepen my introspection. I urge the teacher to believe that I can learn the lesson, correct the mistakes, and work harder to redouble my efforts in the future. At the same time, I sincerely hope that the teacher can continue to care and support me, but I will deal with my problems as appropriate. As early as I stepped into the school, the teacher had already made three appeals and five orders. I repeatedly stressed that the whole school students should not gossip about class during class, affecting the classroom order and the effect of the lectures. But this morning, I was still preparing a teacher for us. I spoke in a vivid class. I didn\u2019t take a good knowledge of the teacher\u2019s hard work. The evening repair is very important. I should cherish this opportunity, but I missed it. This is a big loss in life. Teacher, your concern also deeply touched me. I know that a few people have no loss in class, but you still find and teach me in time, so that I will not commit crimes next time. How kind you are, How great! My grateful tears can fill the entire Tarim Basin; my heart that jumps because of excessive excitement can be compared with the Tangshan earthquake; my prodigal son\u2019s determination to turn back can be overplayed by the son-in-law. I firmly promise that In addition to the very special reasons for early self-study, I will definitely listen to gossip in the classroom. If you pour out the water of the entire Pacific Ocean, it will not ruin your angry flame, then the whole Can the ocean&#39;s water be poured out? No, so I believe that you can forgive me for the mistake I made inadvertently. The reason why I said it was unintentionally was that I had just inadvertently said a few words when I was studying early. This may be just a reason for not being false. The truth is truth. The fact is that I am goingssip about class when I am in class. I hope the teacher can forgive. Sorry, teacher! This time I am committing a serious principle problem. The mistake has been told all the facts like the weapons in the sky. The teacher repeatedly said that the words are still in the ear, the serious expression is still in front of me, I am deeply Shocking, I have already deeply realized the importance of this matter. Nowadays, I am deeply remorseful when I am in a big mistake. I have a deep review and believe that there is a fatal mistake in my own thoughts: I am not high in my mind, I am I don\u2019t have enough respect for others. I will have more respect for teachers in the future. I will pay serious attention to important matters. I usually have a lazy life style. If it is not because I am too lazy, I will not let you do so. I have failed your efforts.\u7ec6\u7ec6. Seeing the micro-knowledge, from small to big, as a junior 2 student, I also spoke in class like a child, and made a bad example for the whole class, which became a very bad influence. For this matter, it caused serious I have made a profound reflection on the consequences: 1. It has caused bad influence among the students. Because I am goingssip during class, it may affect the discipline of the class, and let other students also speak, and they have not listened to the class. It is also irresponsible to the parents of other students. 2. It affects the improvement of the individual&#39;s comprehensive level, so that he can improve under the condition of instinct improvement. Now that the mistake has been made, I deeply regret and deeply review my mistakes. 3. Ideological awareness is not high, and I don\u2019t know enough about mistakes. Imagine that if I realized the seriousness of the incident at that time, mistakes would not happen. All the problems were attributed to the fact that I still have a modern middle school student. Knowing the level of the problem, in order to be able to repay the hard work of the teacher, I am more and more clearly aware of the seriousness of the mistakes I have made. For this reason, I will definitely demand myself more strictly in the next few years.

This place is worth your time to take a trip... A friend suddenly yelled at dinner: &quot;What about the boss?&quot; The waiter was scared enough to think that it happened. What happened, the friend excitedly stood up and said: &quot;This bowl is so beautiful, where can I buy it, can I sell it to me?&quot; It turned out to be a bowl, she just agreed with the boss&#39;s taste. The boss naturally appeared, and said faintly: &quot;I collect, I am good, there is one, I like to send you.&quot; A steaming soul meets another steaming soul. An interesting person said that when I saw something I liked, I would be happy and happy. Of course, what is worthy of his &quot;deaf&quot; are some useless things, such as: a book, a performance, a Good idea... Jiang Xun is very famous in Taiwan, and I am very impressed with what he said. The house where he lives is on the Danshui River, but the developers seem to have no feeling about the scenery and the windows are small. What did he do? He invited the students of the architecture department to open 12 windows at home and push the window out. The scenery was unobstructed. In addition, a small balcony was built. I am very impressed with this picture. I also like people who like many windows and like to see the scenery outside the window. Sometimes, I have to pay a lot of tongues for a position by the window. When I go out to book a trip, the first sentence I ask is is there a view outside the window? For a room with a balcony with a view, I was reluctant to sleep at night, sitting on the balcony for half an hour, and the result was a cold... The person who is so greedy for the scenery is also a steaming soul. They are middle-aged and have excitement. This excitement happens to have nothing to do with the banknotes. A person who loves books, mentioned that he bought a candle one day, and excitedly invited a few friends to eat at home, just because the name of the candle is &quot;library&quot;: damp, ink smell, rain, wood chips... He wants to share the taste of this library. Friends recently attended a graduation concert for a 54-year-old man abroad. The man&#39;s dream when he was a child was to be a musician, but for various reasons, he later learned the aircraft repair profession, and became a senior repair engineer for a lifetime, claiming to be a senior worker. At the age of 50, he is honored to retire. What are you doing next? Realize your dreams. Zheng Er Ba Jing signed up to the university music department to compose music, went to the university with the children for 4 years, graduated at 54 years old, lyrics, composition, performance, piano, violin, harp all come, invite friends and family to join him Concert, this is a touching concert, the friend said that he felt a power and steaming power. People started at the age of 50. However, many young people think that dreams are empty talks, and they can say that there is no dream at all. An American college student who came to travel in the country said that he did not like some Chinese college students because they were boring, and they would not talk about anything other than the house car. Friends say it is very emotional, American universities are not age-restricted, you can often see 50-year-olds and 18-year-olds to learn in the same class, do not interfere with each other, help each other. She said that one day, she saw a gray-haired old gentleman in the study room reading a book seriously. The young people sitting in front and back were like a landscape. Young people from abroad will have a graduation trip, which is intended to find their own dreams. This process can be funded by parents. One of her friends sponsored the child to travel to Mexico, and her child really found her dream there - a beautiful and capable Mexican girl. He rented a coastline (where the coastline is contracted, you can use it, but has the obligation to maintain), and contracted a mountain forest behind the coastline, built his dream cottage by the sea, and lived in South America with his own labor. Go on. His mother not only did not object, but was very happy: Hey, he finally realized his dream, he always dreamed that he had a cabin on the beach, and there was a long-haired girl in the house. Hey, he is alive and well, it\u2019s good. The friend smiled and said that although the Americans are not healthy, they are very healthy. Therefore, they have a long life. Love sports is one aspect, the spirit of relaxation, the influence of enthusiasm on life, and sometimes exceeds the health effects of diet. The Chinese diet is fine and stressful, but the spirit is easy to suppress and always happy. When I think about it, her words really make sense. There are also a lot of fat people in the United States, but they are mostly healthy fat people, and there are very few weight loss sayings. They talk about books, talk about travel, talk about sports, their life is fresh and simple, if you only know how to make money, they will look at you with disdainful eyes, the implication is: you live too hot. Each of us has a lot of &quot;babies,&quot; but you can&#39;t get everything, and at some point you must learn to take it and let it go. It\u2019s courage to take it, it\u2019s a slap in the face, it\u2019s valuable to take it, and it\u2019s detached. The greatest admiration in life is to afford, the greatest comfort of life is to let go.

Scientists are surprised to find that the technology of the electronic arm is very similar to theirs, which means that it is not that the Nazis have undercover in the Aegis, or that Nick Fury helps Baki in the dark. The electronic arm knocked down several scientists and climbed the wall to the side of Baki. Baki escaped from the SHIELD and played with Tony. They are not playing, Baki is not sure if the US captain really wants him to be a successor. Tony tells him that you can&#39;t hope to see someone else inherit the captain&#39;s name. You must believe in yourself. So Baki raised two conditions: 1. Fully scan his brain to make sure there are no brainwashing residues; 2. Go free, don&#39;t be responsible for Tony. [1] In the &quot;Death of Captain America&quot;, the winter warrior Baki became the second generation of American captain. He participated in such big events as &quot;secret invasion&quot;. Later, the former US captain Steve Rogers was resurrected, and Baki still used the name of &quot;Captain America.&quot; In the 2011 event &quot;The Source of Fear&quot;, Baki was &quot;killed&quot; by the original sin (Sin, the daughter of Hung Hom), and Steve continued to serve as Captain America. Baki did not really die, but claimed that he had sacrificed. Only the top staff, Nick Fury, Captain America, Steve Rogers, and Black Widow, knew the secret.

The story of the fox picking peaches There is a peach tree by the river, and the fox built a house by the river. He thought: &quot;There must be delicious peaches to eat in the fall. He said to the peach tree: &quot;Let&#39;s be friends!&quot; Peach Tree happily agreed. It didn&#39;t take long for the peach tree to bloom beautiful peach blossoms, and a strong wind came. The peach tree shouted: &quot;Fox brothers, come and give I keep out the wind, otherwise the flowers will be lost. &quot;The fox said: &quot;I like to eat fresh peaches. As for the flowers, I don&#39;t care. &quot;After a strong wind, the peach blossoms were blown away a lot. Not long after, the peach trees _ had a small peach. The wind came again, and the peach tree shouted again: &quot;Come and help me, or the little peaches will fall.&quot; Empty. The fox said: &quot;I like to eat big and sweet peaches. I don&#39;t care if your little peach can&#39;t fall.&quot; As a result, the little peaches also fell out of the way, leaving only a few small peaches on the tree. After a few days, small bugs appeared on the peach tree. Peach said: &quot;Come help me catch the bugs, I am very uncomfortable.&quot; Fox said: I am only interested in the big peach, do not eat small bugs, no time to help you!&quot; Autumn is coming, the other people&#39;s peach trees are full The sweet and big peaches, but the fox&#39;s peach tree leaves are yellow, and only a few peaches are bitten by the insects. The fox has not tasted a fresh peach. The lazy snake baby was a long time ago. In the beautiful and lush forest, there are a group of cute little animals. Love the singing of the lark, the dancing bunny, the naughty little monkey, and the lazy little snake baby. One morning, the snake baby is still sweet. In my sleep, Uncle Parrot took the letter to the mother of the snake and said that the snake&#39;s grandmother was ill, and let her go to see her old man. The mother of the snake heard it, very anxious. Seeing that the baby is still asleep, I guess I can still get back before noon. The snake baby was ready for breakfast, and he greeted the neighbor&#39;s aunt, and sneaked out. The sun gradually rose. The snake baby woke up. Just wanted to get a lazy waist, but where did the mother go? &quot;Mom, mom, mom. .. .... The stunned and anxious snake baby began to cry. The crying alarmed the little Bailing who was practicing the scorpion. He heard the sound flying over and sang while flying: &quot;Mom has something to travel, and tells the little Bailing. The baby wakes up and doesn&#39;t panic, the pot is fragrant.&quot; I quickly got up from the bed, rubbed my face with a small hand, and smiled embarrassedly. Xiao Bailing was his favorite little friend, crying in front of her, if there was a lot of shame! After dinner, Xiao Bailing called Come to the little friends and let him play with everyone. &quot;I see you playing well? If you don&#39;t mind, I can still take pictures of you. &quot;Don&#39;t just think about being lazy, look at your body shape, don&#39;t exercise, you can&#39;t see your hands and feet. The naughty little monkey is dressed up with various faces to tease him. &quot;Yeah, you don&#39;t exercise any more, just No one likes you anymore. &quot;The beautiful little bunny bounces and convinces him. The cute little Bailing also cheers for him. &quot;Baby baby needs to cheer, exercise and walk more.&quot; Remove the fat and long muscles, we will always be good friends, &quot;Okay. But you have to promise me, can&#39;t laugh at me.&quot; Finally, the little snake baby reluctantly promised to go out. Go out and don&#39;t forget to put a few candy in your mouth. The movement started. First the little rabbit taught him to run. However, only a few meters away, the snake baby is holding a fat body, and he is not willing to move on the ground. &quot;Too tired. I don&#39;t want to go. Unless I let me rest for 30 minutes.&quot; There is no way, everyone agreed. 30 minutes passed, in order to catch the baby&#39;s enthusiasm, the little monkey took the initiative to accept the challenge, when his teacher taught him to change his arms. The snake baby was very interested. As the little monkey rolled over, it didn&#39;t last for half an hour, and it was impatient. &quot;Don&#39;t play, don&#39;t play, it&#39;s too tired. I want to sleep. So everyone promised him to take a break. But this time, the snake baby actually asked to rest for an hour, otherwise he couldn&#39;t stand the body. Helpless, enthusiastic little friend. We only wait, wait. It&#39;s easy to wait until he woke up, the sun father has already ran on the tree. The snake mother came back. The snake baby took the opportunity and found an excuse to go home. Every day, no matter how the mother of the snake swindles, no matter how the partners guide, even the favorite little Bailing does not work. The snake baby does not want to step out of the house, eats sleep all day, sleeps, eats more and more weight, The body is getting more and more empty. Everyone is getting more and more urgent.

violate the teacher&#39;s rules. As a student, we should completely obey the teacher&#39;s words, and I did not pay much attention to the teacher&#39;s words this time. I am very sorry, I hope the teacher can forgive my mistakes. My regrets are really profound. However, people always make mistakes. Of course, I know that I can&#39;t use this as an excuse. We still try to avoid such mistakes. I hope the teacher can believe my remorse. &quot;There are people who have lost their hands and the horses have lost their hoofs.&quot; My bad behavior is not to challenge the teacher&#39;s discipline. Absolutely a mistake, the teacher said that the words are correct, that is, if you want to make mistakes, you should not make mistakes in front of you. I feel really embarrassed, how can this be so. I believe that the teacher\u2019s attitude towards me can also know that I have a very deep regret on this incident. I attach such importance to this incident and hope that the teacher can forgive my mistakes. I can assure the teacher that it will not be in the future. I will gossip about early self-study and any other classes. Today, I really understand my mistake very deeply. I know that what the teacher said should be listened to. The teacher\u2019s words will definitely fulfill her promise. The teacher must manage the students for our students, so we don\u2019t have to challenge the teacher. Discipline, we are still students, the inability to express the disobedience of the words spoken to the teacher, the only thing our students can do is to listen to the teacher&#39;s words, study well, so that the teacher can be assured that the teacher can trust. Making such mistakes is also a big blow to parents&#39; expectations of me. Parents earning money hard, so that our children can live a better life, so that we can devote ourselves to learning, but I am against it. The parents\u2019 minds, I made such mistakes, it is simply a denial of the parents\u2019 efforts. I feel very embarrassed about this. The parents\u2019 fatigue is something we don\u2019t know. Every day, we are busy for survival and bear huge for the family. The pressure, all of this is something we can&#39;t understand. The only thing we can do is to be their embarrassing child. Listening to the words of the parents, the parents are our closest relatives, and we are the most trustworthy in our society. People, so we must try to avoid parents being angry and not giving them unnecessary troubles. And we as their closest relatives can&#39;t provoke them to be angry. This is mutual. When we hurt their hearts, it is also hurting our own hearts, because we are the closest people. No one can replace it. I really feel sorry for this incident. I hope that the teacher can forgive me. I can recognize my attitude of admitting mistakes. I have really profoundly reflected on my mistakes. I hope that the teacher will give me the opportunity to change my mistakes. I also hope that my classmates should also take the lead and not make mistakes like me. The lessons of this time are really big. The nature of the error is serious. I spoke gossip in class and influenced other classmates. The result hurts many interests and has a very bad influence in school. This kind of behavior, even if it does not affect classroom discipline, is still wrong, and the move itself is contrary to the principle of being a student. I just took care of my own moments and thoughts, and completely ignored the teacher&#39;s feelings. This is also wrong. People are social people. Everyone should not just think about themselves. I am doing this. The one who is hurting is the classmates who spoke with me. I am doing this. It seems to be very good with him. Actually, it is Kill him. Moreover, speaking gossip during class is also a disrespect for the teacher. Therefore, the teacher asked me to write a review, which is also to let me deeply understand this point. Secondly, the act of telling gossip during class is also a manifestation of disrespect for the teacher&#39;s work. China is a state of ceremonies. Since ancient times, it has been a matter of respecting teachers. This is a traditional virtue. I have ignored it in the past. Aside from the level, not only the teacher, we should respect him, respect his labor, and the fruits of his labor. In doing so, it directly caused the bad influence of not respecting the teacher, not respecting others, and not respecting the labor of others. As a contemporary high school student, a person who is being educated, this performance obviously does not meet the social requirements for us. Again, my behavior has caused a bad influence among school classmates and undermined the image of the school. Students should learn from each other, promote each other, and have good discipline. My performance has brought a bad head to the students, which is not conducive to the school&#39;s style of study. At the same time, it also caused some damage to the image of the school. &quot;The Eighth Middle School&quot; has always been an academically rigorous school in people&#39;s minds. We should maintain this image instead of destroying it! Although I wrote the answer to other students during the exam, this is cheating. I have a good relationship with that classmate. He talked to me. At that time, I also wanted to speak and thought that the teacher would not find the luck. The consequences of the present. Although being a good person is the fine traditional virtue of the Chinese nation, it is the quality that contemporary middle school physiology should have. But now I am acutely aware that this is not about being good. I am goingssip about gossip in class, but also infect other students. This is not really good with others, but it is harming myself and my classmates. Late self-study is a class for students to review one day of study, no matter what the reason is. Gossip in class is very wrong, contrary to the principle of being a student. Of course, I can&#39;t say that I was going to talk to other students to talk about gossip in class. This is not a reason for me to cheat. Mr. Lu Xun said: Unfriendly help is malicious harm. Only by seriously reflecting on me, looking for the deep roots behind the mistakes, and recognizing the nature of the problem, can we give the collective and ourselves a confession and thus progress. As a student, I didn&#39;t do my own job. I should have never gossip when I was in class, but I spoke gossip during class and lived up to the teacher&#39;s usual education. My teacher has a hard time. Knowledge teaches us that we want to be a useful person to society, but I am telling gossip in class and deceiving knowledge to teach our teachers unselfishly. I have now fully realized that my behavior has not only failed to help. The purpose of the classmates is to harm him and to be a deceptive behavior to the teacher. Since I accepted the teacher\u2019s criticism of me, I have deeply realized the seriousness of this matter. The teacher taught me that the teacher is very concerned. I, love me, so I will listen to the teacher&#39;s words in the future, fully understand the teacher&#39;s request for us, and promise that there will be no similar things happening. If other students are talking to me during class, I will not participate anymore. It is not right to tell him that it is wrong, so that the teacher can help the teacher to worry, and help the teacher to create a good atmosphere for learning. I hope that the teacher will give me the opportunity to rehabilitate myself. The teacher hopes that we will become the pillars of society. Therefore, I will work harder in the study and life of the school in the future. I will not only learn the knowledge that the teacher teaches us, but also learn how to be a good person and do a right thing. Socially useful people, a righteous person, a good student who makes the teacher feel relieved, the teacher is as selfless as the parents\u2019 love for us, so I also want to carry forward the teacher\u2019s selfless spirit to us. Through this matter, I am deeply I feel that the teacher\u2019s feelings of hating iron and steel are not serious. The nature of the mistakes I made is serious. My gossip during class is actually a very bad influence on the class and the department. This unscrupulous behavior, even if the teacher allows it, is in itself a violation of the morality of the students and the spirit of concentration, and violates the principle of fair competition. Such an extremely wrong behavior is typical of the standardism. Especially in a generation of teenagers like me in the 21st century. Carrying forward the hard work spirit of the Eighth Middle School, it is both my responsibility and my unswerving direction to go the way of tenacious struggle and enterprising. However, my behavior runs counter to one another. A good and motivated student must of course strive for good results, but can&#39;t achieve it by desperately and unscrupulously. This is a major principle issue concerning how to be an adult and how to become a talent. The growth and progress of a person is not only the improvement of academics, but more importantly, the cultivation and tempering of ideas and styles. I have neglected such an important problem and made a directional mistake for this. The impact of my mistakes is very bad. Gossip in class, directly in class, directly affects the bad influence of disrespecting classmates, disrespecting teachers, and not respecting parents. In the past, the eighth middle school not only had good grades and good ideas, but also enjoyed a good reputation in terms of spiritual outlook, team discipline, academic construction, etc., and because of my mistakes, it greatly damaged the image of a certain middle school; originally, the teacher It is very important to me. However, my mistakes have deeply hurt their hearts; the mistakes I made have undoubtedly had a great negative impact and brought a bad head; other students are in the process of their growth. Among them, because of my mistakes, they have brought undue negative effects and unbearable ideological pressure. In short, they are deeply saddened and regretted by all the mistakes they have made. The mistakes and lessons I have made are profound. The teachers at the higher level and the classmates are entrusted with heavy responsibilities and high hopes. I have always felt that the responsibility is not great, and I study hard and fully invest. However, it turns out that it is not enough to be enthusiastic, hard-working, and study hard. It must also have a clear political mind, a sense of overall situation, and a sense of discipline. Otherwise, it will lose direction in learning and cause losses to the country and schools. I know that in order to cause such a large loss, I must bear the responsibility that cannot be afforded, especially for those who are educated in key universities. In this error, we should bear the main responsibility that cannot be shirked. I sincerely accept criticism and are willing to accept it. For all of this, I will further summarize and deepen my introspection. I urge the teacher to believe that I can learn the lesson, correct the mistakes, and work harder to redouble my efforts in the future. At the same time, I sincerely hope that the teacher can continue to care and support me, but I will deal with my problems as appropriate. As early as I stepped into the school, the teacher had already made three appeals and five orders. I repeatedly stressed that the whole school students should not gossip about class during class, affecting the classroom order and the effect of the lectures. But this morning, I was still preparing a teacher for us. I spoke in a vivid class. I didn\u2019t take a good knowledge of the teacher\u2019s hard work. The evening repair is very important. I should cherish this opportunity, but I missed it. This is a big loss in life. Teacher, your concern also deeply touched me. I know that a few people have no loss in class, but you still find and teach me in time, so that I will not commit crimes next time. How kind you are, How great! My grateful tears can fill the entire Tarim Basin; my heart that jumps because of excessive excitement can be compared with the Tangshan earthquake; my prodigal son\u2019s determination to turn back can be overplayed by the son-in-law. I firmly promise that In addition to the very special reasons for early self-study, I will definitely listen to gossip in the classroom. If you pour out the water of the entire Pacific Ocean, it will not ruin your angry flame, then the whole Can the ocean&#39;s water be poured out? No, so I believe that you can forgive me for the mistake I made inadvertently. The reason why I said it was unintentionally was that I had just inadvertently said a few words when I was studying early. This may be just a reason for not being false. The truth is truth. The fact is that I am goingssip about class when I am in class. I hope the teacher can forgive. Sorry, teacher! This time I am committing a serious principle problem. The mistake has been told all the facts like the weapons in the sky. The teacher repeatedly said that the words are still in the ear, the serious expression is still in front of me, I am deeply Shocking, I have already deeply realized the importance of this matter. Nowadays, I am deeply remorseful when I am in a big mistake. I have a deep review and believe that there is a fatal mistake in my own thoughts: I am not high in my mind, I am I don\u2019t have enough respect for others. I will have more respect for teachers in the future. I will pay serious attention to important matters. I usually have a lazy life style. If it is not because I am too lazy, I will not let you do so. I have failed your efforts.\u7ec6\u7ec6. Seeing the micro-knowledge, from small to big, as a junior 2 student, I also spoke in class like a child, and made a bad example for the whole class, which became a very bad influence. For this matter, it caused serious I have made a profound reflection on the consequences: 1. It has caused bad influence among the students. Because I am goingssip during class, it may affect the discipline of the class, and let other students also speak, and they have not listened to the class. It is also irresponsible to the parents of other students. 2. It affects the improvement of the individual&#39;s comprehensive level, so that he can improve under the condition of instinct improvement. Now that the mistake has been made, I deeply regret and deeply review my mistakes. 3. Ideological awareness is not high, and I don\u2019t know enough about mistakes. Imagine that if I realized the seriousness of the incident at that time, mistakes would not happen. All the problems were attributed to the fact that I still have a modern middle school student. Knowing the level of the problem, in order to be able to repay the hard work of the teacher, I am more and more clearly aware of the seriousness of the mistakes I have made. For this reason, I will definitely demand myself more strictly in the next few years. I am doing my homework seriously, and I don\u2019t gossip about class at the same time, so that my words and deeds are consistent with a modern middle school student. As a part of gossip during class, I feel it is necessary", "id": "2976369356", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "5", "version": "182.0", "author": "SuRanPink", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Facebook"}
