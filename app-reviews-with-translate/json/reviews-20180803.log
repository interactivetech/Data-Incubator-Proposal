I heard my friends talking about the new update  on Snapchat, and saying they hated it. Personally, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s AWFUL..... it just needs some tweaks... although I never used the app with the old version so maybe it was better. First of all, some of the stories/posts that come up in the Discovery section are kind of inappropriate. Please keep in mind young children are using this app. Plus, most of that stuff is Junk that I don\u2019t care about.

This is surely a problem with the software of the Lyft app. But when I contacted Lyft about this problem they just said \u201cIts likely a problem with the bank but give it a couple days and try again.\u201d They never even checked with their engineering department or submitted any error reports to have it looked into. That is awful customer service. This problem has left me stranded on more than one occasion when I was depending on Lyft and it has never been fixed.\nUse Lyft at your own risk.", "id": "3013017607", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "1", "version": "5.38.3", "author": "ThaiSinger", "country": "US", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Lyft"}

Registered on February 15, 2005, it was created by Chinese-American Chinese Chen Shijun and others to allow users to download, watch and share videos or short films. In November 2006, Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion and operated it as a subsidiary. But Google has always been very cautious about how to make money through YouTube. After the acquisition of YouTube is still popular with global Internet users, Citibank analysts believe that in 2012, Google may receive a net income of 2.4 billion US dollars from YouTube. On January 3, 2014, YouTube announced the demonstration of 4K HD video streaming services at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. The service uses Google&#39;s video codec technology VP9. Unregistered users of the site can still watch the video directly, while registered users can upload an unlimited number of videos. When the film has possible offensive content, it is only available to registered users over the age of 18. YouTube is the current online video service provider in the industry. YouTube&#39;s system handles tens of millions of video clips every day, providing high-level video uploading, distribution, display and browsing services to thousands of users around the world. In February 2015, CCTV launched the Spring Festival Gala for the first time to overseas websites such as YouTube. [1] On July 17, 2015, Google released the second quarter financial report for the fiscal year ending June 30, showing that YouTube now has more than 1 billion users, and almost one-third of all online people in the world. People spend hundreds of millions of hours a day watching videos on YouTube, and now YouTube\u2019s watch time is up 60% year-on-year, the highest level of growth in years. [2] On June 6, 2017, &quot;BrandZ&#39;s Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands 2017&quot; announced that YouTube ranked 65th.

Today\u2019s next three points, Yizhou fatigue (p\u00ed) disadvantages, this is also the end of the crisis. However, the minister of the guardian is unrelenting (xi\u00e8), the loyalty of the loyalty is forgotten to the outsiders, and the cover of the emperor&#39;s special encounter, wants to report to his majesty. Sincerely, the opening of the holy shrine, to the light of the emperor&#39;s legacy (y\u00ed) de, the spirit of the ambition of the ambition, should not be arrogant, quoting the meaning of loss, to the s\u00e8 (s\u00e8) loyalty road also. In the palace, all in one, \u965f (zh\u00ec) fine (z\u0101ng) no (p\u01d0), should not be similar. If there is a rapist and a loyal person, it is advisable to pay a stipulation on the punishment of the guilty person, and it is not appropriate to be partial to the public, so that the internal and external laws are also different. The waiter, the ambassador Guo Yu (y\u014du), Fei Yu (y\u012b), Dong Yun, etc., are all good, loyal and pure, with the first emperor and the singer (w\u00e8i). I don\u2019t think that the things in the palace are small or small, and that they can be consulted, and then they will be able to make up for it. The general is a pet, the sex line (x\u00edng) Shu Jun, Xiao Chang military, tried to use it in the past, the first emperor called the singer, is the public to be the governor. If you think that you are in the camp, you will be able to make a good job. Pro-Xin Chen, far from a small person, this first Han is so prosperous; pro-small, Yuan Xianchen, after that Han is also swaying. When the emperor was at the time, every time he talked about this matter, he did not sigh and hated Yu (hu\u00e1n) and spirit. Waiting for the middle, Shangshu, Chang (zh\u01ceng) history, joining the army, this is the minister of the death of the Ming Dynasty, is willing to marry the pro-religion, then the Han room is long, can be treated as usual. Chen Benbu, who ploughed in Nanyang, squandered his life in troubled times, and did not ask for (w\u00e9n) to reach the princes. The first emperor did not preach (b\u0113i)\u9119(b\u01d0), \u7325(w\u011bi) was wronged, and the three servants were in the grass, and the advisors were grateful for the facts of the world. The value of the latter is overturned. When he was defeated, he was ordered to be in dire straits. He had twenty (y\u00f2u) one year! [&quot;Yes&quot; is a pass-through word, passing &quot;again&quot;, followed by a number to indicate a divisor. So read y\u00f2u] The first emperor is cautious, so it is a big event. Since he was ordered, he (s\u00f9) night sighs, fearing that the payment is not effective, in order to hurt the emperor&#39;s Ming, so Wu Yue (d\u00f9) \u6cf8, deep into the hair. Now the South has been set, the armor has been enough, when the award rate of the three army, Beiding Zhongyuan, \u5eb6 (sh\u00f9) exhausted (n\u00fa) blunt, \u6518 (r\u01ceng) in addition to rape, resurrection Han room, still in the old capital. This minister is therefore the first emperor and the loyalty of the post. As for the discretion of profit and loss, if you make a lot of loyalty, then you can do it. May the next pledge of the princes to seek the revival of the thief, not effective, then the sin of the court, to sing the spirit of the emperor. If there is no saying of Xingde, then the responsibility of blasphemy, blasphemy, and letting is slow to show its \u548e(ji\u00f9). Your Majesty is also advised to seek self-discipline, in order to consult (z\u014du) good deeds, Chana Ya Yan, deep pursuit of the emperor&#39;s will. The minister is grateful for the gratitude!

"title_en": "I am registered", "content_en": "Expanding all the senses is the weakest person in the feudal family. It is an image of intellectuals and &quot;superfluous people&quot; who can clearly understand their tragic fate and action, and is a tragedy of personality splitting under the poison of feudal families and old ethics. Typical, with dual personality, mainly reflected in the following aspects: 1, first of all, with good quality, excellent talent, smart and eager to learn, have a beautiful ideal and pursuit. Gao Juexin is a good boy who is obedient and filial. It is an ideal character of a filial son who is in harmony with traditional ethics. It is the &quot;Ning Xiner&quot; in the eyes of parents, but it is also the Achilles heel that leads to his tragic fate. What is inseparable from his good character is his embarrassment. This character is not only destined to be passive in his life, but also destined to &quot;hidden&quot; all kinds of disasters and bad luck. He once had a dream, wanted to be a chemist, and studied hard. When he graduated from high school for four years, he was the first outstanding student in the school. He wanted to continue to go to university after graduation, and even went to Germany to study abroad. . 2. Secondly, the ideological character was seriously distorted by the feudal patriarchal concept and feudal ethics. On the one hand, he was influenced by the new ideas of the May Fourth Movement, sympathizing with the struggle of his younger brothers, on the other hand, the status of the long-term grandson and The upbringing of the feudal family made him reluctant to accept, objectively playing the image of a defender of the old system of old rites. After graduating from high school, Jue Xin was called to marry home, but the object was not his favorite Mei Chuangmei. Although Xinxin was very painful inside, he did not say a word that he did not want. After the death of his father, the responsibility of the long house fell on the shoulders of Xinxin, and he quickly rushed into the room between the houses in the big family. At first he tried to resist, but his resistance In addition to giving him more trouble, he didn&#39;t use anything at all, so he invented a new way of life: perfunctory, trying to avoid conflicts with the elders, and trying to perfuse them to the extent possible. The new youthful youth and young people&#39;s dreams gradually disappeared in the boring real life. Life blunts his feelings, but he is unable to get out of trouble and often suffers from extreme pain. Under the influence of the new trend of the May Fourth Movement, Jue Xin also read some new books, absorbed some new nourishments, sympathized with the younger generation and their struggles, but the weakness of their own power made it impossible to change the old things, but often In the image of the defenders of the old ritual old system, they appeared in front of the younger brothers and persuaded the younger brothers to give in. He always sacrificed his self in exchange for family harmony, but the result was always failure. He was in the old elders and the radical brother. In the gap between the two, he is not understood by both sides. He &quot;reads a new book and lived an old life&quot;. When he is with the old characters, he is a sturdy high-ranking young master, together with the new characters, and a new youth. In theory, I accepted some new thoughts, but I still loved the old family emotionally and in action. The contradiction between thought and action made him often in extreme pain. Being sober and weak made him unable to get rid of the harsh self-condemnation. These have greatly enhanced the tragic nature of the characters. The formation of the weak and embarrassing character of Jue Xin has its ideological roots. Mainly in the following aspects: 1 The status of the eldest son of Xuan Sun. Jue Xin is the long-term grandson of Gaojia. In the feudal family, the long-term grandson is also called &quot;bearing grandson&quot;. That is to say, the future responsibility of the extended family should be borne by him. He is the heir to the extended family. The structure requires that the new system must be maintained and the family system can be guaranteed everywhere, so that the new fate has already been decided at the time of his birth. After prematurely getting married and his father died prematurely, he upholds his father&#39;s wishes, and in order to protect his own interests, he carefully handles all kinds of personnel relations and humiliating affairs, accepting from The pressure of material and spiritual plays the role of tragedy in life. As a result, there is a sharp conflict between reality and ideal, and it creates the duality of the new character. 2 The feudal hierarchy and the long-term poison of feudal ethics, the combination of the two became powerful forces of political power and ideology. The ethics of feudalism, especially the so-called &quot;filial piety&quot;, the restriction of the special status of the long-term grandfather and grandson has already ruined the vitality and edge of the new life, causing his character of grievance, cowardice and obedience. He is afraid of others to gossip, always considers Guangzong Yaozu, worried that Gaojia is falling from his hands, afraid to bear the guilty charges, so even though he can clearly realize the tragic nature of his own destiny, he always volunteers his head to the noose. It has caused tragedies one after another. This is the national character that our nation generally has under the weight of feudal autocracy. 3 Drawing on Tolstoy&#39;s non-resistance and Liu Bannong&#39;s sectarianism from the May Fourth Cultural Thought. Jue Xin was influenced by the new trend of the May Fourth Movement, clearly recognizing that the old family and the old rituals took his youth, but he and the other people from the May Fourth Cultural Thoughts have different concepts of human rights and equality. What is learned from it is Tolstoy&#39;s non-resistance and Liu Bannong&#39;s sectarianism. He believes in this kind ofism because such a theory can make the theory of &quot;New Youth&quot; not conflict with the reality of their big family. The combination of the ground makes him convinced of the new theory on the one hand, and on the other hand can live in the old environment, and he does not feel contradictory. 4 The new tragedy is not only the tragedy of character, but also the tragedy of society. It sums up the life and fate of the entire generation of intellectuals in the feudal world, and has the profoundness and typicality of tragedy. Although Jue Xin always sacrifices the self in exchange for family harmony, but the cruel fate is dedicated to the new honest man, he lost two of his dearest women in succession: First, Mei Cousin suffered from long-term depression. The lung disease died; not only was his wife, Ruiqi, who was told by the superstitious elders to leave the house at the time of childbirth, and died in the cold earthen houses in the suburbs. I feel that the new inner heart is extremely desolate and lonely. Only his younger brother, Minmin and Huihui, understand a little, but they can&#39;t help the brother who has been unable to fly.", "id": "3011417572", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "5", "version": "183.0", "author": "\u4faf\u5b87\u6052", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Facebook"}

Can I use children who are not comparable to others? No, I am much better than the children of other people, but you are not willing to admit it. I have many friends, one of whom is Wang Xxx. It is more of a school. It is a schoolmaster. My mom often compares me with him. His mother also compares him with me. I think this is the parent. . Although I am not a class with him, but our two English is taught by the same teacher. She always likes to say that other classes are good in front of our class. In other classes, I like to say that our class is good. Every time I go to the physical education class, the math teacher will say that the physical education teacher is ill. Later I realized that it was a lie. It seems that I was deceived for six years. When I was in elementary school, we hope that the elementary school will graduate quickly, but graduate. When I didn&#39;t want to leave elementary school, it probably should have been with us for too long. Of course, I am going to junior high school soon. When the subject is going to increase, I have to work hard.

"title_en": "Comment on the comment, give it to me", "content_en": "I have mentioned an abandoned ancient garden in several novels, which is actually the altar. The tourism industry has not been carried out many years ago, and the garden is ridiculously deserted like a wild field and rarely remembered. The altar is very close to my home. Or my home is very close to the altar. In short, I have to think that this is a fate. The earth altar was located there for more than 400 years before I was born, and since my grandmother came to Beijing with my father when I was young, I have been living in a place not far from it for more than a fifty years. Home, you can move around and stay around it, and the closer you move, the closer it is. I often feel that there is a fateful taste in the middle: it seems that this ancient garden is just waiting for me, and I have been waiting for more than four hundred years. It waited for me to be born, and then waited for me to live to the most arrogant age and suddenly crippled my legs. For more than four hundred years, it eroded the glass of the ancient temple and exaggerated the glazed glass, and faded the red glazed on the door wall. It smashed a section of high wall and scattered the jade carving bar. The old cypress trees around the altar are more and more visible. The secluded, wild grasses and vines everywhere are also flourishing. At this time, I must have come. One afternoon fifteen years ago, I walked into the park with a wheelchair, and it prepared everything for a lost soul. At that time, the sun was following the path of the ancient 3, and it was getting bigger and bigger. In the calm light of the garden, it is easier for a person to see the time and see his own figure. Since I accidentally entered the garden that afternoon, I have not left it for a long time. I understood its intentions at once. As I said in a novel: &quot;In a densely populated city, there is such a peaceful place to be like God&#39;s painstaking arrangement.&quot; In the first few years after the two legs were disabled, I could not find a job. I couldn&#39;t find a way to go. Suddenly I couldn&#39;t find anything. I just shook my wheelchair and went there. It was just another world where I could escape a world. I wrote in that novel: &quot;I have nowhere to go, I spend it in the garden all day long. Just like going to work, when someone goes to work, I shake my wheelchair here. The garden is unattended, commuting time. Some people who took shortcuts passed through the garden, and they lived in the garden for a while, and then they quieted down.&quot; &quot;The wall was slanting in the golden air, and I walked in the wheelchair and put the chair back down. Sitting or lying down, reading a book or thinking about something, slap a branch and slap it around, and drive away the little insects like me who don\u2019t understand why they want to come to this world.\u201d \u201cThe bee is like a small fog that steadily stops in the air. The ant shook his head and shook his head and touched the tentacles. He suddenly thought about what he had, and turned and went away. The ladybug climbed impatiently. When he was tired, he prayed and opened his wings. He flickered and lifted off; Hey, loneliness is like an empty house; the dew rolls and gathers on the blades of grass, and the grass leaves are bent and collapsed, and the golden light is broken.&quot; &quot;The gardens are all the sounds of the grass and the competition,&quot; It\u2019s a moment.\u201d This is all true.", "id": "3013471074", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "4", "version": "4.55", "author": "\u767e\u5e74\u5b64\u72ec\u767e\u5e74", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "GoogleMaps"}
