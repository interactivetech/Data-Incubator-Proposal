First I had to reply to two different messages then five days later I had to verify it was my email address. I got a message and was asked what my issue was after answering that question three times in previous messages. When I explained about the update using space for ads for the Uber credit card I explained that I pay for the service and I don\u2019t want to see ads on the app. The response message was obviously an algorithm robot and said \u201cif your having problems with the app crashing, delete and reinstall\u201d.

"title_en": "Why is it so troublesome to note a book?", "content_en": "The ancients said, &quot;Life is not as good as ninety-nine.&quot; In the event of &quot;unsatisfactory things&quot;, many people will inevitably have all kinds of complaints, resentfulness, and grievances are not good. In life, complaints are completely negative emotions and full of negative energy. In fact, if people start to complain, then the relationship between the two people will be in jeopardy. There is nothing between loved ones, friends and colleagues. When you regard complaints as a habit, subtly implant a negative mentality into your heart. Your world outlook, outlook on life, and values \u200b\u200bare all pessimistic. It can interfere with your life and affect your relationships. Lu Xun&#39;s Xianglin was originally a very compassionate and compassionate person. From her experience, she is indeed a woman worthy of sympathy. But why did it end up in an annoying tragic role? Because she loves to complain, everybody complains that her son was taken away by the wolf, people began to sympathize with it, and for a long time they were suspected and often degraded. Because living in the old times, coupled with the pessimism of life, finally made her a tragedy in the tragedy. The experience that is worthy of sympathy, often complaining, will become a thing that is not worthy of sympathy, because in the eyes of others, you are a person who is not strong inside and lives in hopelessness. Zeng Guofan\u2019s life can be said to be smoother and better. But his brother, the situation is not so good. His four brothers and six younger brothers are all supervised students who spend money to buy, and the younger brother and the youngest brother, although they have taken the test, have stopped here. These four younger brothers are more depressed, so there are many words of discontent. Zeng Guofan\u2019s six-year-old Zeng Guohua\u2019s talent in writing is very high. Zeng Guofan has been expecting him to take the title and do his career. Zeng Guohua is also very confident, but in the examinations of the imperial examinations, he has repeatedly lost. This is a big blow to him. The young boy who once had a high ambition has repeatedly hit the wall on the road of imperial examinations. His mentality has plummeted and he has been complaining all day long. Zeng Guohua complained that the examiner had no vision and could not understand his own article; he even complained that his wife did not manage himself, and that he did not do his best to study. But I never found the reason for myself. After Zeng Guofan was informed, in the book he wrote to Zeng Guohua, he criticized him for a meal. Zeng Guofan said with no mercy: &quot;You can&#39;t test it, it&#39;s because you didn&#39;t work hard, you gave up on yourself, who is it? You have any qualifications to complain!&quot; In Zeng Guofan&#39;s opinion, complaining too much is a performance without a break. It is impossible for people who complain about a little bit of setbacks to have a good future. Zeng Guofan said: &quot;The complaints are too much, and then there will be more suppression.&quot; If there is no reason to blame the sky, then the sky will not be allowed. If there is no reason, then people will not be convinced, and the reason is also reasonable. Those who complain too much, the road ahead must not go well, because he will not reflect on himself and will not improve and improve. Failure is inevitable. And his complaints will arouse the resentment of others, and people will stay away from it. &quot;The Analects of Confucius and Constitutional Questions&quot; records that Confucius lamented: Do not blame the sky, not especially people, go to school and go up, know me! Confucius traveled around the country, hitting the wall everywhere, and if he had lost his dog, he never complained. Do not blame the sky, not people, but know how to cultivate self-improvement and self-improvement. Born to be a human being, each has its own suffering, no one is born to be a small sun, and growing up, stepping into the workplace, the first step in doing things, but just swallowing hard, hiding tired, controlling their own language and emotions .", "id": "3015042084", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "5", "version": "183.0", "author": "\u5fc3\u91cc\u82e6\uff0c\u6ce8\u518c", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Facebook"}
