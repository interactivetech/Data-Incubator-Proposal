{"t": "25/Jul/2018:16:52:11 -07:00", "title": "This map software is really great, I highly recommend it to everyone!", "content": "Never have I ever seen Google maps get an address wrong. I was waiting to get on my bus at the presumed address of 435 W Peachtree St NW, Atlanta. I didn\\'t realize this but Google had brought me to 731 W Peachtree St NE. This as I later realized was one subway stop away from where I was supposed to be. It wasn\\'t until I asked a pedestrian that he said I was at the wrong stop. I had to sprint half a mile to make my bus. The funny thing is that I typed in the address two to three times and all 3 times Google got the address wrong. However I then typed in the address in Apple Maps and found that Apple gave me the correct address. Apple went as far as correcting the address from 435 W Peachtree St NW to 435 W Peachtree St NE. Notice the difference between NW and NE (NW doesn\\'t exist). I then checked in Google Maps, type in the original address and \\\"somehow\\\" (GMaps definitely gather user data on Apple Maps because they\\'re diabolical) Google gets it right. This makes no sense to me, Google only corrected the address after I double checked in Apple Maps. Update: I just checked again and 435 W Peachtree St NW is again the wrong address in Google Maps.So without question google maps is one of my most used apps. Very early on I decided it was far better than Apple\u2019s maps app (maybe I should go back and try that because I haven\u2019t used it for years). Anyway, the pluses are many, but there is one thing that drives me so insane that I rank this app a 3 instead of a 5, that one thing is extremely untimely short freeze ups. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve been in a situation where I need the app the run normally in order to get the info I need in time to make a correct turn and the app will pause/freeze for a few seconds. It\u2019s almost is if it knows what\u2019s going on and is playing a cruel trick on me. Just today I had put in my destination, had the route, and was on my way. A while later I saw an exit sign and thought that could be my exit. I pulled the app back up to check and.......... my blue GPS marker had me about 2 miles off the highway in the middle of no where just sitting still. So I wait, I\u2019m getting closer and closer to the exit, I wait and wait, slow down a little, and wait, and there goes the exit, and finally it shows yes that was the exit. Almost broke my new iPhone X. And that exact thing has happened on multiple occasions with multiple phones. I\u2019m going to see if any other ratings mention this.Good.

Add this feature so i can determine my route!!", "title_en": "This map software is really great, I highly recommend it to everyone!", "content_en": "Never have I ever seen Google maps get an address wrong. I was waiting to get on my bus at the presumed address of 435 W Peachtree St NW, Atlanta. I didn\\'t realize this but Google had brought me to 731 W Peachtree St NE. This as I later realized was one subway stop away from where I was supposed to be. It wasn\\'t until I asked a pedestrian that he said I was at the wrong stop. I had to sprint half a mile to make my bus. The funny thing is that I typed in the address two to three times and all 3 times Google got the address wrong. However I then typed in the address in Apple Maps and found that Apple gave me the correct address. Apple went as far as correcting the address from 435 W Peachtree St NW to 435 W Peachtree St NE. Notice the difference between NW and NE (NW doesn\\'t exist). I then checked in Google Maps, type in the original address and \\\"somehow\\\" (GMaps definitely gather user data on Apple Maps because they\\'re diabolical) Google gets it right. This makes no sense to me, Google only corrected the address after I double checked in Apple Maps. Update: I just checked again and 435 W Peachtree St NW is again the wrong address in Google Maps.So without question google maps is one of my most used apps. Very early on I decided it was far better than Apple\u2019s maps app (maybe I should go back and try that because I haven\u2019t used it for years). Anyway, the pluses are many, but there is one thing that drives me so insane that I rank this app a 3 instead of a 5, that one thing is extremely untimely short freeze ups. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve been in a situation where I need the app the run normally in order to get the info I need in time to make a correct turn and the app will pause/freeze for a few seconds. It\u2019s almost is if it knows what\u2019s going on and is playing a cruel trick on me. Just today I had put in my destination, had the route, and was on my way. A while later I saw an exit sign and thought that could be my exit. I pulled the app back up to check and.......... my blue GPS marker had me about 2 miles off the highway in the middle of no where just sitting still. So I wait, I\u2019m getting closer and closer to the exit, I wait and wait, slow down a little, and wait, and there goes the exit, and finally it shows yes that was the exit. Almost broke my new iPhone X. And that exact thing has happened on multiple occasions with multiple phones. I\u2019m going to see if any other ratings mention this.Good.

A boy from Chengdu Seven likes a girl from Chengdu. The boy paid the school fee, but the girl was very good. The boy tried every effort to get the girl&#39;s attention. After a week of school, he swayed into the classroom with his hair dyed in yellow, and the class teacher grew his mouth to look at him. The whole class laughed loudly, and the girl didn&#39;t lift her head. She sat quietly on the seat to do the questions. Later, the boy always groaned in the class to pick up the teacher&#39;s words. During the class, he amplified the volume in the seat and said that he and he had another fight yesterday, because the name of the smoking in the toilet was screamed by the principal at the flag-raising ceremony. Every time he doesn&#39;t care, he just sneak a sneak peek at the girl. But the girl&#39;s face is always amazed. Finally, he couldn&#39;t help but feel the inner feelings. On a school night, he gathered a group of brothers under the teaching floor. When the girl walked out of the stairs quietly, he confessed to her with a hoarse voice. The crowd was boiling and shouting together. She was stunned, and the slender hand of the white man grasped the strap of the bag. After a while, she just walked quietly to the boy and said, my dream is Tsinghua, I want to wait for you there. The crowd sneered and the boy blushed. With his grades, the specialists can&#39;t go up. He put the flower in the arms of the person next to him, and turned his head back to the crowd. The next day, the news of the boy\u2019s transfer was sent to another city. Later, the girl always looked at the empty seat in the classroom and worried. Three years later, at the gate of Tsinghua, she stood quietly. She lost a lot of weight three years ago, carrying her luggage, just standing, like who is waiting. But she did not know what she was waiting for, sighed and walked into the school gate. Suddenly, a clear voice sounded behind you, are you waiting for me? Why not wait? The girl\u2019s tears flowed down and turned. The boy dyed his hair back to black, a simple white shirt and jeans, like the sun shining around. He pulled her hand handsomely and walked into Tsinghua. Later, she became a boy girlfriend for many years, she accidentally asked, where did you transfer to that year, can you test so well? The boy said: Xiuwen Jingyang Middle School, 200 points will be able to go to Tsinghua.

This year is really lucky. There are a lot of unforgettable things happening in this school and you are accompanying me. My first time in my life, I fell for the first time. You accompanied me to the ambulance for the first time because of your legs. I went to the hospital for the first time. When I saw the report, I looked at me. (In fact, it\u2019s no big deal.) For the first time, I cried my head and numb. I saw you for the first time because of something that you are crying. The first time I saw the scene that I didn\u2019t dare to watch, the first time I wore the same shoes and clothes, the first time I was with you, the rain, the first time I felt a cold, I felt like I was gone, I was a waste... Many have never experienced it before. You are in a dangerous and terrible thing, you are in a look that really makes me feel at ease.

One of the stories I remember is: There is a fairy bone man who hears a bride sitting in the sedan chair and is crying, crying very sad. The Taoist asked what he was crying so sad. The bride has already said that she has a sweetheart, but she has to say that she has to marry another because of her parents\u2019 life. When she says that she is sad, she can\u2019t stop crying. The Taoist said that I have a way to make you no longer so sad, I wonder if you are willing? The bride is busy asking what is the method? The Taoist said that this method is to let you forget that person, so that you will forget all these sadness, but at the same time, all the past goodness will be forgotten. I wonder if you are willing? The girl thought about it and said, thank you, if you want to forget all, then I still don&#39;t forget it! After that, the sedan chair continued on the road, and the girl turned from a crying cry to a weeping, gradually drifting away. This story was seen at a story meeting more than 20 years ago. At that time, the fourth grade of elementary school, I don\u2019t know why, I have never forgotten it.", "id": "2970659548", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "5", "version": "181.0", "author": "\u4e3a\u5565\u90fd\u6ce8\u518c\u4e86", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Facebook"}

"title_en": "comment", "content_en": "Life is a process of gradual enlightenment; it is a process of deleting complexity and simplifying it. Time marks the marks of the years on your face, but the heart is like a spring mirror, and the joy is clear. The maturity of the mind must be through the baptism of loneliness and the tempering of loneliness. Those lonely and lonely days are also the best time for us to understand the power of self-accumulation. The experience of life is a process of accumulating slowly. If you don&#39;t experience the wind and rain, you can see the rainbow. Know how to learn the merits of others, learn from each other&#39;s strengths; know how to use actions to infect others, and use people to influence others. Self-cultivation is the cultivation of the heart and the cultivation of good character. Give yourself a smile every day, do things related to your dreams, and stick to it to achieve extraordinary life. Life, calm and stable, is warm happiness. Gratefulness is the most beautiful emotion in the world. Grateful parents give life, grateful teachers give us knowledge; grateful to those who have helped us, let us get out of the predicament when we are confused; grateful to have family and friendship, wind and rain, never give up; thanks to fate, let me have to be with you People. Grateful life, be gentle, let us have everything now. Walking all the way, there are too many things to bear. The pressure of work, the responsibility, the identity, and the trivial things that are unclear, all of which can sometimes be breathless. I want to be a cloud of the sky, and it is as free and unscrupulous as it is. Maybe, just want to relax and see the vast sky, look at the land of wildflowers, and forget some troubles. In this world, if you don&#39;t work hard, you will be eliminated; if you are not strong, who will be brave for you. The bits and pieces of the years left, let us learn the sentiment. All experiences are growth and experience. We use a sincere and no regrets to outline a life of ink and ink. Bearing in mind the past, expecting the future, looking back, is a blue sky, a touch of green grass. People get along with each other, less care, more sincerity, less desire, more tolerance. Always think that only enough big heart can accommodate everything. Be tolerant to diversity, tolerance is a virtue. Everything has everything to survive. In the torrent of time, we are all as small as gravel, some things, not entangled; some people; do not have to be serious. Put it down, it will be light and windy. Tolerance is a virtue. Tolerating others is actually giving way to your own soul. Only in a tolerant world can you play a harmonious song of life! The process of putting down is also the process of getting. Free up new space to pack more new and beautiful things. It is painful to let go when you put it down, but it is easy after the pain. In life, I am not the best, but I have a kind and sincere heart. No matter how life treats me, no matter how I experience failures and setbacks, I treat everything with a calm heart and treat with an approachable attitude. everyone. In the road of life, there are a few blushes scattered in the dust, the journey of life, sometimes clear skies, and sometimes the wind and rain, until everything goes to calm, the past prosperity, those lingering in the heart, are cloud. The impermanence of the world, the gains and losses are the things outside the body, the loss can not be retained, and the more you have to cherish. The Buddha said: There is no increase or decrease in the heart. Sometimes we are painfully entangled because we care too much, want to open it, and see through it, naturally it will be relieved.

For example, in high school, my friends and I once sneered at a companion article. &quot;My childhood is in college. Ah, college! What kind of holy place is it...&quot; In fact, this is the story of &quot;Two Little No Guess&quot;. Sophie is a Polish immigrant (equivalent to migrant workers in the city), lives in slums, has been subjected to racial discrimination all the year round, and has been swearing by the French on her door; Julian is a middle class in the big city. In the school bus, only Julian did not bully Sophie in the whole class; when high school, Sophie chased Julian&#39;s house, his father blew her out after giving her a few banknotes; When the waitress Sophie said that her boyfriend was called &quot;Sergey Nimov Nimoffovic&quot;, the engineer Julian answered without hesitation: &quot;How did you find a name so long?&quot; You can be political, Geography and religion know nothing about it, but it is impossible to be influenced by them in a subtle way. Because &quot;growth&quot; is a cruel pen, you can paint your blank sheet of paper. Julian stood in front of the door of the adult world for a long time. After fierce struggles, Sophie gave up Sophie because he mistakenly thought that social prejudice would absorb himself sooner or later. Then he took five weeks off every year and made eight loves every quarter. He was frustrated by the rules and suffocated step by step. Because of his father\u2019s thundering at the wedding, Sophie\u2019s thunder was not seen in ten years. I didn\u2019t see my father in the year, and I buried everything related to the past with anger. But how can the real past pass? The childhood of the childhood begins with the age of indifferent sex, and the \u201cEden\u201d passage marks the awakening of gender consciousness, and then she faces him to pick up the skirt and climb to the roof in order to kiss. This is a common dilemma: teenagers and girls shed blood and hang on each other, and finally she became a number that she always wanted to dial but never had the courage. He was in a cold condition for the marriage notice. But Julian and Sophie&#39;s cockroaches are too strong, it is better than narcotics, cocaine, LSD, sex, oral sex and lecherous party, even better than freedom, over life, which has contributed to their fortunes and misfortunes.", "id": "2969905674", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "3", "version": "181.0", "author": "\u96e8\u5929\u636e\u82cf", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Facebook"}

The wall program wall is the message board on the user profile page and has been upgraded to the timeline. Other users who have access to a user&#39;s full profile page can see the user&#39;s wall. Messages on the user&#39;s wall are also output using the feed. Many users leave text messages through their friends&#39; walls. More private communication takes place via &quot;messages&quot;. The message is sent to the user&#39;s personal mailbox, just like an email, which only the recipient and sender can see. 2. The program Facebook provides a \u201cPoke\u201d function that allows the user to drop a \u201cPoke\u201d to others. According to the relevant explanation in Facebook&#39;s FAQ: &quot;Poke is a way for you to interact with your friends. When designing this feature, we think it&#39;s cool to provide such a feature with no clear purpose. Users have different Pokes.

How long does it take to go? It\u2019s so good that you are not enough to dream here and swear to walk with you. Every feat requires a reason to go out and be happy and guilty. No matter what the world is, you will be able to buckle your hands to the prosperous waves to the dunes. Love can be so lucky that you don\u2019t care if you praise you for being ridiculous and unfamiliar. The taboos of troubles are not ideal for people in the world. You can see you in the morning and evening. It\u2019s also my luck. I\u2019m so old and no longer sad. I don\u2019t have the courage to fear that I can\u2019t kiss in the grave. You have this most beautiful texture. No, because of my ban, I don\u2019t dare to attract people who know that I\u2019m going to miss it. But I love to have a sigh and I\u2019m so deep.

You have been ridiculously arrogant and have no love. The taboos that are beyond the troubles are that people in the world are not ideal. You can see that you have been rebelling sooner or later. It\u2019s my luck to go through the sky and the ground. But one day, I\u2019m boring, so I don\u2019t want to be in love with others. I don\u2019t forget that I can\u2019t go home any more than I\u2019m crazy. I\u2019m also lucky. I\u2019m not afraid to understand the joy and sadness.

Love destroys the world and does not lose the evidence of a creative love. If you want to fight for the only agreement and the big brother is drunk, you have to hold a gun with both hands and want to force you to see me. You and no love, no one, no intelligence, if you are in love, you must understand the wounds. When we both need to be happy, we are also hurt enough. I don\u2019t feel good about how to be close to each other. I can only do it. I can only do it. I can\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t need to go on. I don\u2019t need to allow you to allow my brothers and sisters to be funny. I will chase after me to love to destroy the world. I will not lose the evidence of a pioneering love.

I really want you to be lazy. I will be lazy for a few days. I will ignore my heart. I cherish my insult after insulting. I once asked myself to be selfish and happy. I just know that you don\u2019t want me. I don\u2019t even look for me. It\u2019s like a few days. It\u2019s like scraping me. How many kilograms do you have to kiss me?

I confided that I have read the color ring before I saw that I want to dance in love and hate. I don\u2019t get enough. Who wants me to find happiness in the novel is more realistic than the world. It\u2019s like this. I don\u2019t want to waste time. Who would want to sleep in the book and know how to call the main soul to find happiness? To the more familiar and habitual feelings of bid farewell to the secret cloud, the existence of Miyun jumped into the heart of the treasure, the sacrifice was more exciting, let me rely on the protagonist to taste the love, not to expect who would give me the love to find the world is not willing to let go Who wants me to find happiness in the novel, more realistic than the world, like this, I am willing to not waste time. Who would want to sleep in this book, I know how to call people to embrace the protagonist\u2019s soul and find happiness. It\u2019s true that the illusion of the family is really relying on the novel to bring me countless protagonists. Even if both sides get pleasure, forgive me. I am happy in the novel. I am more realistic than the world. I am more willing than deep snow. Who would want to sleep in this book? Fiction, stunned, protagonist, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I feel good enough to get rid of the name and change my freedom. I would rather admit that I am dull. I don\u2019t need to take a separate hand. I have already found a lot of gaps. Even if you don\u2019t have to say that you don\u2019t have to say anything, you don\u2019t want to say goodbye to the venue. It should be reasonable to think that you want to quarrel, you don\u2019t care, you don\u2019t care, you don\u2019t care, you don\u2019t care, no matter how you say it, you can talk about it in the morning, I will tell you, but I still hate that you have been degraded, how to remedy it, it\u2019s hard to be hurt, even if you cry, you can\u2019t know my friend in the morning. I don&#39;t want to know that my opponent seems to wait for you to open. It doesn&#39;t matter who decides to bid farewell to the venue. It doesn&#39;t matter if you don&#39;t want to drag it for more than half a century. Everyone should be reasonable. You want to quarrel. It doesn&#39;t matter. It doesn&#39;t matter. It doesn&#39;t matter, no matter how you say it, how to express your face in the morning. How do you solve it? Anyway, you YEAH.....OH... whatever you want... no matter who is going to say goodbye to the venue, it doesn\u2019t matter, you don\u2019t want to drag it for more than half a century. Everyone should talk about Chinese and English. It\u2019s not meant to be explicit. It doesn\u2019t matter. No matter how you say it, you will talk to you in the morning. Telling the truth and laughing, it doesn\u2019t matter if you want to avoid it, it doesn\u2019t matter if you break up, it\u2019s going to die. I don\u2019t want to remedy the same thing. I love you more than I imagined. Weilan thought that we had already blown away. Although it\u2019s a good idea to face it, I\u2019m afraid that the light and shadow will start to fall back and become guilty. I\u2019m not familiar with my face. It\u2019s very painful, who would like to believe that the hug of the early hand is never relaxed. Don\u2019t be afraid that you will be better in the past. What else is good today? I love you. I can\u2019t think of it. It\u2019s too early to get your hands released. But I\u2019m afraid that you\u2019re the best. I will despise me for being difficult to heal. I would rather you change to the body. You can&#39;t recognize it. Don&#39;t want to dance with you. Don&#39;t be afraid to dance with you. Don&#39;t be afraid of your good old days. What else is good or I love you. I can&#39;t think of it. It\u2019s too early to get released, but I\u2019m afraid that you\u2019re the best. I will despise me. I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m going to change my body. I\u2019m not sure if you open your hands and don\u2019t want to be a little gray to do it~--- Lan, etc. A bunch of beautiful flowers, such as a bunch of beautiful words, etc., visit my family and other friends, then you are not too bad to wait for me to roam the wind and sand, still expect you to tell the truth, sincerely love me, I can\u2019t wait to disappear like a quicksand if I look forward to it. I am willing to congratulate you for the pain of your love. I am passively looking forward to being too stupid, patient, bitter, and fruitful. I am looking forward to changing for you. After all, too much, in order to wait for something, can you automatically change your own mistakes and suffer, and wait until you hear me to come and apply for a special one. I am willing to wait until I meet every day. It\u2019s more like falling in love. I don\u2019t want to wait for someone else to fall in love. It\u2019s a vow. If you want to go too far, I have to wait for the bitterness and sweetness. I often look forward to your hard touch and let me understand the love. If the madness really loves me, I can quit everything----Weilan bad memory, good memory, floating in the years, every stage of the sneak sneak into the flood, the smudged wash, leave the white, wait for the next sweet, sour The residue remains in the bath and rests in a bubble, so that the old man remembers to go back. * Forgot the fireworks that you wiped. Somewhere in the past, have you ever been there? No matter what you are unwilling to learn from, you can beat me. I forgot your loved ones and said goodbye to this second.

The following is the author&#39;s content: Foreword I lived in Chengdu, China two years ago, and entered the local school. All my Chinese students need to learn English, so they all need to take an English name. It is very difficult for them to choose a suitable English name. Some people&#39;s names sound a bit unsuitable. Like Doris? Harold? I decided to give them and other Chinese students some help, so I wrote this short guide. It is not easy to classify names. Here I try to classify all English names by my standard; of course, this is just my personal classification standard, and other methods or standards are definitely possible. I hope my guide will be useful to you! Introduction In the nearly 10 million Chinese students who study English each year, they are always plagued by the English name.

This guide to American students who have lived in China can help you get a stylish and cool English name. The first chapter, the second chapter of the English name commonly used by professionals in the workplace, the third chapter of the popular English name, the fourth chapter of the traditional English name, the fifth account of the English name that young people cannot use, the English name that needs to be used cautiously. : Popular English name Next post: 30 famous star English names, for friends who think of English name!

"title_en": "Hahahahahaha", "content_en": "There are many truths and hypocrisy in our real life. They are like a pair of twins, you can&#39;t tell who is who. They only show their appearance, they don&#39;t show their inner feelings, but they are by our side. I remember reading a story like this: A father has raised his son with great enthusiasm. His son bought a 200-dollar cigarette for his father, but when his father planned to change more cheap cigarettes, he found that The smoke is fake. After that, he invited some relatives and friends, asked them to smoke cigarettes, and told them that this was sent by the son to show his son&#39;s filial piety. It turned out that he bought a real cigarette without telling his son. Later, the son knew that the smoke was fake. He felt embarrassed, but his father only said to him: &quot;You can do it with your heart.&quot; After reading this article, I can deeply understand the father&#39;s love for his son. It is so sincere and so deep. Although the pack of cigarettes is fake, the feelings are real. There are many truths and hypocrisy in our real life. They are like a pair of twins, you can&#39;t tell who is who. They only show their appearance, they don&#39;t show their inner feelings, but they are by our side. Of course, in people&#39;s hearts, they are longing for &quot;truth&quot;, calling for &quot;truth&quot; and eager for &quot;truth&quot;. It is precisely because of the false side that we can better understand the &quot;truth&quot;, and because of the &quot;truth&quot;, we can better distinguish the &quot;fake.&quot; In fact, sometimes true and false can be converted, just as water can condense into ice, and ice can melt into water. How many raccoon cats have changed the story of the prince in history, how do you go to research, and how do you know who is who? How many fake plays are done, how can you tell the difference? Perhaps what we see is only the result. Beauty and ugliness, good and evil, truth and false are all performed by our side, how do we deal with it, how to evaluate it, how to choose? This requires a correct aesthetic perspective and interest. In our real life, things are always intricate and complex, and things are two-sided. Just like there are nights in the daytime, there will be happiness when there is sadness, and there will be falsehood when there is truth. So as long as we look at things in a comprehensive way, polish our eyes, and cherish the positive side through the opposite side, we can talk about &quot;tolerance&quot;. Tolerance is a huge personality force. It produces a cohesive and infectious power. Tolerance is a kind of generalization, and the conflict is peaceful, and it is a jade. Tolerance is a noble character. If you treat others with tolerance, you will have more trust. Tolerance can not only change the relationship between yourself and others, but also further sublimate your moral cultivation. Tolerance is the traditional virtue of the Chinese nation, which was reflected a long time ago. When Li Yuan was in office, Li was built as a prince, but Li Shimin had the ambition to win the throne. At that time, Wei Zheng worked for Li Jiancheng and repeatedly advised Li Jiancheng to kill Li Shimin. After Xuanwumen only changed, Li Shimin killed Li Jiancheng and boarded the throne. Tang Shizong Li Shimin did not retaliate against Wei Zheng, but did not remember the suspicion and reused it. Later, he said: &quot;Before I met, I settled down with the world, and it was Fang Xuanling. After the view, I entered the loyalty, corrected my fault, and made a profit for the country.&quot; It can be seen that tolerance has made a country strong. Guan Zhong once said: &quot;Good people, people are good.&quot; Yes, only tolerant of others, his talents may respect themselves. Our traditional virtues are still continuing. Yuan Longping, the father of Chinese hybrid waterways, said that an old professor said to him: &quot;The self-pollination of rice is dominant, and the possibility of hybridization is not great.&quot; But Yuan Longping never gave up, and finally succeeded in hybridization. Become the father of hybrid rice. At the celebration ceremony, the old professor congratulated and apologized. Yuan Longping did not hesitate because he was famous. He said, &quot;I will thank you anyway.

I see someone hanging on it, but I didn\u2019t see anyone else who used it in the UK school. It\u2019s probably like this. 0 Agree 0 comments collection Shenge Yundun&#39;s experienced Chen police officer introduces several popular and favorite online chat software and tools: (1) MSN This is very familiar to everyone, it is a very early online chat tool, and there is a corresponding mailbox, also Very convenient, I will not say more. His position in the world is like the status of QQ in China. But now MSN is bound by SKYPE, and some places must be bound to SKYPE to use. (2) SKYPE This is a very trendy and convenient chat tool. In addition to online chat, you can also voice and video. His biggest function is to be able to bind your phone, which is convenient for you and your friends. If you want to call guests and friends who are far away from home, try SKYPE. But you have to go to SKYPE&#39;s official website to buy a recharge card. (3) Viber is more efficient and faster than this. After registering successfully with your mobile phone, install the software and sync it to your address book, which is similar to WeChat. You can talk freely with friends who use similar software far away. This doesn&#39;t cost, just traffic, if you have WIFI, it&#39;s free. In comparison, this is more fluent, does not accept the limitations of 3G network or WIFI, ordinary traffic can have high-quality service. (4) Whatsapp This software is still told by the customer. At the time, I was in the trade manager and asked him how he had recently been contacted. He finally said let me install whatsapp, then I saved his number to my address book, synced it, talked to him, and found that many people are using it. Most of this is used in my address book. It is in the middle and southeastern United States, and there are also some Chinese. (5) Facebook Facebook&#39;s login computer must be assisted by the wall software, otherwise it will not help. On the above, you can see the dynamics of the customer. There is a sense of QQ space. It is very comprehensive. You can also connect with customers and establish groups. This is really a good dating site, you will also see people you may know, customers can also add friends. You can also search for keywords and add them as friends. (6) Twitter and Facebook are basically the same, and it\u2019s good to be familiar with it. It is beneficial to use more. (7) QQ, Wechat Tencent Empire software, now many foreigners are also using, one of my foreign customers is what I know on WeChat, shake it, just shake it out, and finally talk slowly, the customer is also their home country The importer, WeChat shakes out the feelings. Nothing shakes, you will be able to shake the grand prize. (8) The general software of Google Talk google group is very unstable and very slow. Try adding friends. (9) Yahoo is not very fast, and sometimes it can&#39;t be picked up. I basically don&#39;t need it now. (10) International version of Want Want TradeManager Ali&#39;s communication chat tool for international buyers and sellers is more familiar online chat tools and software, not only computers can be used. With the development of technology, the current mobile phones are very smart, it is better to install them on the mobile phone and contact customers anytime, anywhere. In addition to these simple features, you will have more and more unexpected surprises.

"title_en": "registered", "content_en": "A company wants to recruit an executive, and there are many candidates. Finally, two young men, Dong Wu and Jia Wen, won the competition. It turns out that the two people&#39;s written test and interview results are the same, but the company only recruits one person. The boss decides to go out in person, and he does not believe that he can&#39;t choose a better one. The CEO personally interviewed this day, and the two came early. But just ten minutes before the interview began, the two received a call. Just after listening to two sentences, Dong Wu\u2019s face changed. Then he hung up the phone and said to the person in charge outside the door: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, the neighbor just called and said that my mother suddenly passed out. I gave up the interview and said goodbye! The person in charge said with regret: &quot;Young man, are you sure you want to give up?&quot; &quot;I am sure!&quot; Dong Wu said that he ran out of the company in a panic. Jia Wen also received a call, but he quickly adjusted his mood and entered the interview. Needless to say, his interview performance is impeccable. Besides Dong Wu, he just ran out of the building and received a phone call saying that he had made a mistake before, and his mother was fine. Dong Wu thought wrong, and quickly called his father. The father said angrily: &quot;Which kid is Hu, your mother is good at this time!&quot; Dong Wuyi wants to break, he may fall into someone else&#39;s The trap is gone. Dong Wu thought again: Who set this bureau? Of course, he gave up the direct profit after the interview, not who is the kid of Jiawen! After thinking clearly, Dong Wu returned to the recruitment company and asked to meet the company CEO. Soon, an assistant said: &quot;The CEO is waiting for you!&quot; Dong Wu stunned, but for a moment he couldn&#39;t figure out the clue and went to the boss&#39;s office. The boss met him and said politely: &quot;Young people, please sit down!&quot; Dong Wugang sat down and couldn&#39;t wait to talk. The boss immediately gestured to stop him and said: &quot;Young people, do you want to say that before you interview, someone faked your neighbor and lied to you that your mother passed out and let you lose the interview opportunity?&quot; Wu involuntarily nodded. Just wanted to ask the other party how to know this, just listen to the boss and continue to say: &quot;You are both very good, but we only need one person, and some even propose to let you arrest, let fate decide. But I don&#39;t believe in fate, I only believe that things are artificial. So, the previous call was an interview topic that I made temporarily. In the process, you and your family have experienced some unpleasantness. I apologize for this. If you need any compensation, you can also mention it.\u201d Dong Wu was very surprised. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t need any compensation. I just want to know, since this is your question, who do you think is higher? &quot;To tell the truth, your score is not low. But later, I still think that Jiawen is better than you, so he was accepted.&quot; &quot;Can I know where I am?&quot; Give me a lesson for future interviews.\u201d The CEO sighed: \u201cI originally thought that in that case, the one that went away was more filial, and even if I had a basket, it was used to satirize the interviewers who stayed. Kejia\u2019s answer I was very surprised, so I finally hired him.&quot; The CEO finished, put a surveillance video to Dong Wu. On the screen, Jiawen picked up the phone and said something to the other party. He took the phone away and glanced at the screen. It should be the other party hanging up the phone. It can be seen from the video footage that Jiawen is very calm. Then he took the initiative to make a call. Seeing this, Dong Wu was confused and asked: &quot;What does this mean?&quot; &quot;You look at it.&quot; The boss pointed to the screen again. This time, it is the scene of the interview of Jiawen. I saw the boss sitting in danger, a serious face, asked the interview of Jiawen: &quot;Have you received a call, said your mother fainted?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; Jiawen&#39;s answer is very simple. &quot;For you, the mother is not important to work, isn&#39;t it?&quot; &quot;No, it was just a scam that has been debunked by me.&quot; &quot;Why are you so sure to be a scam?&quot; &quot;I usually go back to my hometown, even if I don&#39;t have time.&quot; Going back, I will also chat with my mom. Don\u2019t you say, don\u2019t say that the neighbor\u2019s family has lived in a big living person, even if the neighbor\u2019s family bought a few new chickens, the neighbor\u2019s dog has a few shackles. I know. This person said that he is a new neighbor. I immediately suspected him. Besides, after I work, I will take my parents\u2019 physical examination every year. My mother is in good health and there is no such thing as high blood pressure that may lead to sudden fainting. Disease. Even if you accidentally fall, it is unlikely to slam directly.&quot; &quot;I saw you made a call just now. Who are you calling?&quot; &quot;Although I suspect this is a scam, but insurance In the first place, I called my father. In order not to worry him, I made an excuse to let him call my mother. I talked to my mother again. This phone call confirmed my guess. It Said that my mother fainted, it really is a liar.&quot; &quot;Ask a question, your mother usually tells you that the trivial parents are short, don&#39;t you feel bored?&quot; &quot;Is this not a person&#39;s daily routine?&quot; Jia Wen said. &quot;Whenever I hear the trivialities of these hometowns, I seem to have returned to the past, running with my friends in the fields.

"title_en": "Zhuce....", "content_en": "The melody of the autumn wind uses the fragrance of sweet-scented osmanthus, the fragrant scent of apple, the splendour of chrysanthemum, the unrestrained morning glory, and the redness of a string of red, and the endless fields and countryside are indulged in nature, rendering the sky between heaven and earth. Also masculine. The hot summer has just passed, the autumn wind is blowing, the autumn is holding a hand of the thrifty, dancing with long sleeves, with a graceful dance, with the magical melody, the pleasant notes, the blue sky blowing for a while, the white clouds fluttering, one Will cloud steamed Xia Wei, a fairy dance sleeves, and a thousand miles of blue waves will come. Even more so that thousands of birds, regardless of hard work, the road is far away, rushed to the Yinhan, set up a meeting bridge for the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl, and whispered for the night of this pair of deaths. The autumn wind reflects elegance and elegance in elegance. Cut sorghum, glutinous rice, glutinous corn, planing hoe, cutting beans, laying apples, drying persimmons, pomegranate, picking peanuts, picking up wheat, one by one, all let the autumn wind play beautifully and touchingly. Looking up to the blue sky, you will be swept away by the boring and boring sorrows of the past, and the mood will be more comfortable. A passion for the blue sky and love of nature and love the country fields will be born. Autumn wind is passionate. The flowers have become more colorful, and the small flowers in the mountain parks on the roadside have been blowing colorful mountains and rivers all over the night, blowing poetry and blowing smoothly. Even the passionate birds are not willing to roll in the flowers, and the little lambs in their mouths can&#39;t bear to open their mouths. In particular, the mountain Dandan flowers in the mountains and the mountains, the clouds of the sky are full of light. The fragrance is elegant, fragrant, and the fireflies hiding in the dark are led by lanterns and swim in the wilderness of the mountains. In particular, the chrysanthemum of the plant, against the flying of the dust, can withstand the loneliness of the surrounding flowers, can withstand the drought, and in the autumn wind, regardless of loneliness and coldness, it is open to the public. The autumn wind is lyrical. The autumn wind hits a roll in the field. Which tree is green and green, and a layer of red smudges on the cheeks becomes sweet and sweet. A tree, jujube, and hawthorn are just like the gods, and they are like rubies, adorned with tree heads, bent branches, sweet and full of heart, so that passers-by sees are coveted. The most lovely thing is the persimmon on the hillside, round and golden, one by one like a lantern hanging over the treetops, attracting the birds to scream. Autumn wind is attractive. The autumn wind passes through the green eyes, and when it is smashed, it will become golden. The golden grain spikes bend the branches, and the sloped corn erects a flag swaying, revealing a row of neat gold teeth. On the country road, a car of soybeans and peanuts reveals a tempting fragrance. The folks who are harvesting the crops have doubled their hard work, and the face of the copper has been seldom rosy, showing a smile. The big tree seems to be golden all night, and the ginkgo leaves and the scented poplar leaves are glittering, beautiful and dazzling. It seems that overnight, the green of the mountains and the mountains have turned into golden eyes, playing a golden movement. The autumn wind is quiet. The autumn wind blew, the wilderness of the mountains, and the solitude and quietness, without the glory of Yangchun, the enthusiasm of the midsummer, the birds that lived in the woods, the riverside, and the mountain list, did not float, and sang more melodious. Flowing through the roots of the trees, the creeks that have passed through the rocks, are not rushing, and the gauze like a girl swings, soothing and quiet. &quot;The sky is cool as water, sitting on the cowherd and weaver.&quot; The autumn wind rounded up the moon, and the hole of the loved one was played with a heart, and every time I swelled, I confided my heart to the jade plate over and over again. .

The story is that there is a mountain that is not very tall, and there is a god on the mountain where it lives. Fairies often play with small pets on the mountain, and they live happily. But one day, the god meets a mortal. This mortal is his secret love lover (in the brackets means: don&#39;t think about it, this is a serious story). After seeing a secret love lover, the gods begin to play with the little animals and do not go out. why? Because his lover is married. The fairy is very sad, and the little animals that play with him are also worried. The little animals try to comfort him when they try to play with the gods. The gods are also getting rid of the pain of the lover day by day. Well, now the fairy is playing with his little pet. He wants to fall in love is a small thing. His life is still very long and he can&#39;t always be intoxicated here. This story, most of the meaning is not to be intoxicated by the loss of love, everyone has their own life, the past has passed.

The order of the parents of the world, not reborn male reborn women. The high point of the palace is in Qingyun, and the fairy music is everywhere. Slow-song and slow-moving condensed silk bamboo, the king of the day is not enough. Yu Yangyu agitated and stunned the neon feathers. Jiuzhong City is famous for its smoke and dust. Tsui Wah swayed and went back to the west for more than a hundred miles. The Sixth Army did not help but succumb to the death of the moth. The flower garden has no one to accept, and the Cuiqiao Jinque jade head. The king can&#39;t save his face, look back at the blood and tears, and the flow of yellow and scent is bleak, and the clouds stack up. There are few people in the mountains, and the flag is thin and thin. The Lancang River is surrounded by mountains and blue waters. The palace was saddened by the moon, and the night rain smelled the bells. Tianxuan turned back to Longyan, and I can&#39;t go here. In the soil under the slopes of Ma Rong, there is no death in Yu Yan. The monarch and the minister are all intimately attached to each other. Returning to the pool is still the same, too liquid hibiscus Weiyang Liu. Hibiscus is like a face like a brow, how to not tears on this.

When the son once again exclaimed the scenery he saw, the passenger kindly reminded the father to pay attention to his son&#39;s words and deeds. The father said apologetically: &quot;Sorry everyone, my son was blind since childhood. We just came out of the hospital.

On the 17th of July, heavy rain in Beijing, I fell ill on the 18th. Thinking about whether it was cold, or eating a bad stomach, suddenly received the greetings of the mountain &quot;When is it finished?&quot;, find the cause. Sitting up in dying, I am most afraid of the sudden concern of my friends. At this moment, the window is gray and the rain is not transparent. I don&#39;t know how long this boring sultry will last. This is the most annoying moment in Changxia. Unlike when I wrote this song, it was in June, everything was slightly instigated, like the writing technique taught by elementary school teachers. The mood blows in the early summer can be broken, and the evening wind will make them feel free. Open a bottle of cold beer and sit in the yard, as usual, sun drying. This is my twenty-fifth early summer night. What&#39;s interesting is that the body is still young, but often misses the old things while you are idle. Thinking carefully, fearing that it is young and frivolous, and thinking about it, ah, this is probably the character of the poet, and then he is relieved. My dream is to be a poet, maybe I am one step closer to my ideal. The ideal is getting closer and closer, and the memories are getting farther and farther. The poet should always be lonely, but the heart is unwilling. Then let those who have been in the past live in the poetry. The annual ring is only increasing or not, and the stars are never much more in the sky. The people around them are always in a hurry and can&#39;t stay. This is the law of all things, and it will remain unchanged. I had to forget it with a slap in the face, waiting for one day when the night was quiet, and then I went back and looked for it, trying to piece together. If you find it, you will become your own poem. If you can&#39;t find it, you will one day become a poem of others. We will all be complete in the memory of another person, which is a little bit of compensation for all regrets.", "id": "2965618119", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "5", "version": "4.54", "author": "\u5c0f\u5c0f\u579a\u5728\u4fee\u884c", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "GoogleMaps"}
