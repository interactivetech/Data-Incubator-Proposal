Looking at the inspirational article she wrote, the article said: Thanks for poverty, despite narrowing my vision, stabbing my self-esteem, and even indirectly taking the life of my close relatives, but I also want to say, thank you, poor. I think it would be great if she wrote the sentiments of her schoolmates. She is still a child who has not gone to the society. Her understanding of poverty can greatly impress those students who have been studying in the early days and study hard in the country. The college entrance examination is an opportunity for only a few counter-attacks into &quot;nobles&quot; in life. Her article is slightly biased, but it is sincere enough to be inspirational enough to be a role model for the students. On the way to the Jinci, where the brave people meet, the savvy facts are enough to understand the cruel facts. In fact, she should be grateful to her loved ones, and the humblest and most primitive inducement that prompted her to be angry was from the environment of the hopeful child. She gave thanks to the seemingly &quot;fatal&quot; condition and potentially showed her betrayal of poverty. Looking at the photos of this child, there is a shadow of Fan Xiaolan. The exquisiteness of the five senses of no one has absolutely the temperament of poetry and poetry. This is somewhat wrong than it is. It is necessary to know that life is an unequal reality. There is no need to defend your own life, but it is even more important to remember that people can only succeed in self-defense. Understanding the suffering, calmly facing, and having the spirit of being one and ten deep, and not returning, this is the mission of Confucianism, and the mission of learning and being good. Take a backpack and go far from the ideal moment. Don&#39;t forget the long pavilion in your hometown. There are past sufferings and ideals.

Nothing to complain about, all your encounters now are paying for your own. I believe that there must be a person you love in this world. He will pass through the crowds in this world, walk through them one by one, with a heart beat and hold a lot of heat and heavy. Love, come to you, hold on to you, he will find you, you have to wait until I always think that I won, until one day I see myself in the mirror, I know that I lost, at my best time, My favorite person is not with me. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u300a\u4e1c\u90aa\u897f\u6bd2\u300b Remember one issue of &quot;Lang Reader&quot;, Yao Chen said: &quot;Most of the encounters in life will inevitably face separation.&quot; Dong Qing said: &quot;In fact, when we One day, in recalling those people who met in the past, if we can think of more of a simple, friendly and kind, this is our luck.\u201d Yes, it\u2019s a sea of \u200b\u200bpeople, you can meet each other.

Beating heart adults rarely cry like children when they leave, sometimes even serious and decent. We all understand that many people see one side and a lot of contacts just add trouble to each other. This raw mountain is long and long, we will inevitably experience loss and separation, but people who have come to your life have already taught you something. In this case, grateful is good. There is a kind of feeling, called not disturbing, there is a kind of care, called the opposite, it is better to forget about the rivers and lakes. I only hope that we will live happily without each other&#39;s days. In the future, we will all be right, we will all be fine, aren&#39;t we?

The sin you committed can never make up for it. You can meet each other. A great fate, not to mention the long way to go. It\u2019s a pity that it\u2019s better than tens of thousands of times.

In this world, the best thing is to arrive as scheduled. The saddest thing is that the person is gone, you can&#39;t miss it. All tears have a name, the most bitter one, called regret.

Mount Fanjing: National AAAA-level tourist scenic spot, national nature reserve, China&#39;s top ten summer famous mountains, China&#39;s famous Maitreya Bodhisattva Dojo, member of the International Man and Biosphere Protection Network (MAB), and also the 42nd World Natural Heritage recognized by the World Heritage Convention. Fanjingshan is named after \u201cBanatian Pure Land\u201d. It is located at the junction of Jiangkou, Yinjiang and Songtao in Tongren City, Guizhou Province. It is 2493 meters above sea level and is the main peak of Wuling Mountain Range. The forest coverage rate is 95%. It is a rare Buddhist temple in China. And the nature reserve, together with Wutai Mountain in Shanxi, Putuo Mountain in Zhejiang, Mount Emei in Sichuan, and Jiuhua Mountain in Anhui, are the five famous Buddhist mountains in China. The original floodland is the landscape feature of Fanjing Mountain. The four waterfalls of Yun Waterfall, Zen Mist, Phantom and Buddha Light add a mysterious color to Fanjing Mountain. The iconic attractions include Hongyun Jinding, Yuejing Mountain, Wanmi Sleeping Buddha, Mushroom Stone, Wanjue Sutra, Jiulongchi and Fenghuangshan. Fanjing Mountain has more than 2,000 species of plants, 31 species of protected plants, 801 species of animals, and 19 species of animals protected by the state. It is known as the earth oasis, the animal and plant gene pool, and the precious heritage of mankind. There is the momentum of Huashan, the grandeur of Mount Tai, the strange stone of the rabbit ear, is a tourist destination. Fanjing Mountain is one of the most unique landmarks in Guizhou. It is the Lingshan Mountain in the east. It is an ecological kingdom. It is a scenic spot. It is a pure land of the people. It is a returning to the true, the body and mind, the fascinating world of fairy tales and natural oxygen! The famous poet Wang Xinjian&#39;s poem &quot;Over Fanjingshan&quot; is a poem that is close to the mountains, only the bamboo sounds. The heart is pure and earthy, pushing the clouds to the Brahma. The Zen fog enters the valley, the Buddha light is on the Cangyan. The followers of the sea, continue Xianyuan.\u201d It is a testament to the beautiful scenery of Fanjing Mountain, which makes people forget the fascinating scenery of the world. On July 2, 2018, Fanjingshan, Guizhou Province, China, was approved for inclusion in the World Natural Heritage List at the World Heritage Conference in Manama, Bahrain.

"title_en": "Just be alive", "content_en": "&quot;When the wind and rain dangle the wings of dreams, when the rainbow has not reflected your face, I believe that love is an eternal vow.&quot; Without a children&#39;s song can make people cry like this, this song seems to be a paradise at that time. The angels pray for people. We are all singing softly: candlesticks, fireworks, sorrows and sorrows in the wild, the night is full of whistling, 50,000 old people have gone through it, take three steps, look forward to thousands of times, return to look at the broken mountain road, v. Not far from the hustle and bustle. Qingming rain fell thousands of times, naked mountains, green graves, today&#39;s old dreams a few \u6101? interrupted, but no frown. The Wenchuan earthquake has hit 1460 days, 21 hours, 33 minutes and 47 seconds. Four years have passed. The memory of that day is still so clear. I still remember the panicked look. I still remember the helpless expression at that time. I still remember that time. Fortunately, after the robbery, I still remember that at that time, I would never give up on life. I still remember that we had all the hearts and minds to fight against the disaster in the same boat. I remember the moment when Premier Wen arrived, I still remember Zhao Pu\u2019s tears, remember Dong Qian Middle School teacher Tan Qianqiu opened the body of the guardian wings. He still remembers that Hanwang\u2019s man\u2019s motorcycle was dead and dignified. He still remembers Tang\u2019s strong smile and remembers the optimistic spirit of the Coke boy. He still remembers the first batch of 200 officers and men. I ventured into Wenchuan\u2019s heroic spirit. I still remember the heroic attitude of the fifteen warriors when I was airborne. I still remember that the people of the whole country had difficulties in helping out. I still remember the help from volunteers from all over the country. I still remember too much. I have always wanted to forget, but I can&#39;t forget the painful time. After the earthquake, I joined the Volunteers Association. I was fortunate to meet a volunteer of migrant workers who came to Tangshan. He was called Jia Haiquan. About 30 years old, a person who was thrown into the crowd and immediately disappeared, and the family also had senior parents and A wife who didn&#39;t have a job, but he heard that after the Wenchuan earthquake, he immediately quit his job and bought the train ticket for the day. We volunteered to be a very ordinary volunteer in Sichuan. The most done thing every day is We are carrying disaster relief supplies everywhere. I asked him: Why did you come to Sichuan? Is your family opposed? I heard that you don\u2019t come to Tangshan to be famous. Why don\u2019t you be with them? He smiled faintly and said: Isn\u2019t this difficult to support? The Tangshan earthquake did not help the Chinese compatriots to support us. This is to repay, I will do my own, where is not all help? This is the most ordinary people in China. They don&#39;t have high academic qualifications, they don&#39;t have good conditions, but they understand one of the simplest truths, knowing the truth! I just wanted to burst into tears at the moment. Afterwards, I want to ask him to have a good meal. I can say whatever he wants, but he can\u2019t live or die. Although we are still texting contact every year and every holiday, we haven\u2019t been able to have a good meal with this big brother. It is my most regrettable thing. I don&#39;t know how long it will take to get a chance to get drunk with Jia Da Ge. Thank you! The dead have passed away and pray for them. Also pray for the living people, we are vulnerable. Year after year, 5.12 is drifting away from us, the past has been written into history, and the new future is being written. On the land where the tears are poured, the flowers and plants are sprouting. It is like the mulberry-like green, and the summer color should be quickly laid for this piece of land. The wound did not fall, we personally folded a paper crane and flew it into the wind, hoping that the breeze could hear our prayers and let the paper cranes bring greetings to the compatriots in heaven.", "id": "2995481153", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "5", "version": "182.0", "author": "\u6670\u5a03\u5a03", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Facebook"}

It is necessary not only to clarify the shape, proportion and size of the object, but also to overcome the planar depiction and to have the most basic understanding and mastery of the shape. Without the sense of volume space, you can not develop the habit of observing the volume space, and can not express the spatial relationship. The expression of space is the basic ability of painting. For example, when the head of the character is on the front side, the eyes and ears are in the same direction. The beginner often cannot express its sense of space, and there is no sense of volume when there is no sense of space. &quot;Square&quot; and &quot;square&quot; are not the same, the square is a plane, and the square is a volume. So the ability to create spatial awareness to represent the volume of an object should be established. Expressiveness is critical in sketching. With a keen eye for observation, we must also build awareness of the overall consciousness and volume, so to achieve these requires the ability to perform. Sketch is the most basic form of painting for representing or reproducing objects. As a method and means of learning painting, sketching must grasp the factors and structure of the body, understand the shade of light and shadow, understand the boundary line and the boundary between light and dark, and the feeling of rhythm. Sketch is more rational than color, especially the training of basic sketches. Use rational guidance to observe, use observation to enrich rationality, and build sketches on rational understanding to achieve the integrity of the sketch. The above analysis and understanding of some of the more prominent points in sketch teaching. Painting is a skill class and must be leapfrogged from practice. Therefore, hands-on practice is very important. With the accumulation of quantity, we can get a qualitative leap. A solid sketch foundation can be used to test the ideal result. Painting is a kind of art that is hand-picked in nature on a two-dimensional plane. In medieval Europe, painting is often called &quot;the art of monkeys&quot; because it is like a monkey. Like imitating human activities, painting is also an imitation of the scene. Before the 20th century, the more realistic the painting was, the higher the technology. Different painters have different styles and different artistic values. At the beginning of the 20th century, the styles of some painters were left out or even degraded because they were unacceptable to the reviewers. This is why some painters paint well and are not famous or even frozen to death or starve to death. Oil painting and watercolor painting are the most well-known painting categories in Western culture and art. They have rich and complex traditions in style and theme. In the East, black and colored ink painting dominates the choice of painting media, but it has the same rich and complex traditions as the West in style and theme.", "id": "2995312536", "voteSum": "0", "voteCount": "0", "rating": "5", "version": "182.0", "author": "Kimi\u3001\u5929\u5929\u3001Cindy \u3001\u77f3\u5934", "country": "CN", "store": "iTunes", "app_name": "Facebook"}

One of the best things about Spotify is that if you\u2019re listening to someone else\u2019s playlist (which you can search up), you can skip any song you don\u2019t like! It\u2019s also great how I can make my own playlists so that I can listen to the music that I want to hear and only that!\n\nHowever, you can ONLY listen to music if you have a playlist, and if you don\u2019t have enough songs, Spotify will add their own, which can only SOMETIMES be helpful.

My current salary is really not enough. I heard that the national football team members are all with an annual salary of tens of millions.

Third, the opponent&#39;s players can also play with the ball. I easily shake me; Fourth, face the opponent&#39;s goal, I can&#39;t shoot the ball; Fifth, I can&#39;t take the ball that my teammates passed to me; 6. I can&#39;t pass the ball accurately to my teammates; On the court, I will also eat chewing gum; 8. I also dare to judge the referee on the court; 9. Lose the ball, I will cry in the face of the media, and then like nothing else; Ten, I can often pick up girls at night; Lose the ball and get 3 million bonuses. I can also accept the money without a red face. 12. If I lose, I will also send Weibo and blame our fans. If it doesn&#39;t work, I can still be a commentator with a million-year salary, because I can also explain the national football team&#39;s game. Interpretation, anyway, just a few words: 1, the time left for the Chinese team is not much. 2. The situation of the Chinese team is very serious. 3. This year&#39;s venue/weather has caused great obstacles to the Chinese team. 4. Danger. 5, there are opportunities. 6. Now there is only theoretical possibility left in the qualifying. 7.
